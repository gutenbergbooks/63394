<br /><span class="h2line2">THE DERELICT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong over yonder,
Osceola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, Bill? What are you talking
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Seminole chief spoke from the
rear cockpit of Bill Bolton&rsquo;s two-seater amphibian,
into the transmitter of his headphone
set. Bright August sunshine painted a calm
Atlantic brilliant blue two thousand feet below
the speeding airplane. Cirrus clouds like fleecy
wisps of carded wool flecked a light blue sky
which melted into the sea on the unbroken circle
of their wide horizon. Since passing Cape
Hatteras Light Ship flying north a quarter of an
hour before, neither lad had seen a single thing
to relieve the monotony of an empty ocean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought my eyesight was better than
average,&rdquo; Osceola continued, scanning the
horizon, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see a blessed thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more habit than good vision&mdash;spotting
something at sea,&rdquo; returned Bill from his place
at the controls. He clapped a pair of field
glasses to his eyes. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a single stacker off
our starboard quarter. She&rsquo;s almost hull down
to the horizon. I&rsquo;ve been watching her off and
on for the past five minutes, and I&rsquo;ll swear
she hasn&rsquo;t moved an inch. What&rsquo;s more&mdash;the
glasses don&rsquo;t show the slightest sign of
smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can make her out now. Think she&rsquo;s worth
while investigating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. There&rsquo;s something queer about
that ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not investigate then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my idea. The people on board may
be in a bad way. It&rsquo;s our duty to be of help if
we can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, but&mdash;how about the time,
Bill? You father expects us in New York this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Bolton banked to starboard, then
neutralized his ailerons when the plane&rsquo;s nose
was headed toward the dot on the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The airline distance between Miami and
New York City is one thousand and ninety-five
miles,&rdquo; said Bill, applying a normal amount of
right rudder to offset the torque. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a good
deal better than half way now, and we&rsquo;ve made
swell time with this light wind on our tail all
the way. Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll see the Statue of
Liberty before they turn the floodlights on her
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Your father is such a grand guy&mdash;he&rsquo;s
been so wonderful to me and my people
ever since we cleaned up that Martinengo
gang&mdash;I&rsquo;d hate to disappoint him. And especially
so now when he is giving me this trip
north.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;I savvy,&rdquo; Bill replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty fond of
Dad myself&mdash;but he&rsquo;d be the last person in the
world to suggest we pass up anything like this,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought the glasses to his eyes again and
stared through them for a full minute without
speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nearer we get, the queerer she looks,&rdquo;
he muttered finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some kind of a yacht, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is. And a whopping big one. But that&rsquo;s
not the point, Osceola. She&rsquo;s not moving, yet
she hasn&rsquo;t broken out her breakdown flag at the
fore. She isn&rsquo;t even flying her colors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anyone on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither can I&mdash;and still, if she was
abandoned after sunset yesterday when her
colors had been hauled down, why doesn&rsquo;t she
show her three red lights in vertical line&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the sign of a ship not under control?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some mystery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say you&rsquo;re right, Osceola. And
what&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t like it&mdash;not one little bit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Bill banked until the amphibian was headed
into the teeth of the light breeze. With the
wings level once more, he closed the throttle
and pushing his stick forward, sent the plane
into a normal glide. At an altitude of about
twenty-five feet, he began to break the glide
with a slow backward movement of the stick.
With expert precision he gradually decreased
their gliding angle until they were in level flight
with the bottom of the hull perhaps a foot above
the water. Although the plane was steadily
losing speed he did not yet permit his craft to
make contact; but continued to pull back the
stick gradually raising the nose and depressing
the tail.</p>
<p>Like every other trained aviator he knew that
as a plane approaches the stalling point, its nose-heaviness
increases sharply and the stick must be
pulled farther back to compensate for this.
When his point of stall was reached, Bill pulled
the stick fully back, completing the stall. The
step of the hull made contact. There was no
rebound. For an instant, the plane skimmed the
surface, then floated forward. A few yards to
windward lay the yacht, broadside to the gentle
ground swell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Bill ripped off his headgear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slap your feet on the pedals, Osceola,&rdquo; he
called. &ldquo;Keep her headed for that gangway
amidships. She&rsquo;ll fetch it all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply, he caught up a
looped mooring line and climbed out of the
cockpit. An instant later he stood on the heaving
grating, with the taut line wound about his
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come aboard!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Make it
snappy, will you? This ship&rsquo;s rolling like a
drunken sailor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The agile Seminole landed beside him and
the two lads ran swiftly up to the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks deserted, all right,&rdquo; Bill eyed Osceola,
while he played off the line to the plane,
then made it fast. &ldquo;Packed your gat, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The young Chief grinned, and nodded emphatically.
&ldquo;You bet.&rdquo; He produced an automatic
from its holster below his left armpit. &ldquo;I
do everything except sleep with this since the
Shell Island mixup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill nodded. &ldquo;Me too, old man. From the
lay of the land, we&rsquo;re alone on this craft. Still,
you never can tell. There&rsquo;s something uncanny
about a sea mystery&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a swell ship.&rdquo; Osceola motioned
toward the polished brass and mahogany.
&ldquo;Some rich man&rsquo;s plaything, I guess. Must
have cost a pretty penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she must have carried a large crew. I
wonder where everybody disappeared to! I
don&rsquo;t know how you feel, but this ship gives me
the creeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve got my gun.&rdquo; Osceola released
the safety catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t stand here all day,&rdquo; declared
Bill. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take in the engine room first.
There can&rsquo;t be a leak. She&rsquo;s too high in the
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we get down there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;The thwartships passage forward of the
main companionway is probably what we&rsquo;re
looking for. Let&rsquo;s go see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill entered the passage with Osceola at his
heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain&rsquo;s and chief engineer&rsquo;s quarters,&rdquo;
said Bill, glancing through the open doorways
on either hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And everything is in apple-pie order,&rdquo;
added Osceola.</p>
<p>Bill stepped inside the captain&rsquo;s cabin and
began to rummage, pulling out drawers at the
small desk and bureau. &ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;&mdash;not a sign of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; Osceola sat
down on the captain&rsquo;s bunk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not being a sea-faring man yourself, you
probably don&rsquo;t quite realize <i>how</i> darned mysterious
this business is.&rdquo; Bill slammed a drawer
shut in disgust and turned toward his friend.
&ldquo;This ship has no name!&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;Oh,
she had one, all right. I spotted the marks on
the hull, under a fresh coat of paint where the
metal lettering had been&mdash;even before we came
overside. And her boats, lifebuoys and belts are
gone. I thought I would find the logbook or
some of her ship&rsquo;s papers in the skipper&rsquo;s cabin&mdash;but
I&rsquo;ve drawn a blank. There isn&rsquo;t the
merest scrap of paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; remarked Osceola thoughtfully,
&ldquo;the lads who had these cabins left in a hurry.
I may be what you Naval Academy midshipmen
call a landlubber&mdash;but I can see that they left
their clothes behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s eyes crinkled. &ldquo;Right you are. Let&rsquo;s
go below now. I don&rsquo;t think Sherlock Holmes
could dig any more dope out of these cabins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A steep stair further along the passage led
down to a roomy forecastle, which, like the
cabins above, they found empty. Next to the
bunkroom were a crew&rsquo;s mess, lazarette and
galley&mdash;likewise deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Bill!&rdquo; cried the Indian, lifting
a lid from the cook range.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Bill bent over and was astonished to see the
red bed of glowing coals. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be doggoned!
That fire has hardly burned down at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has put coal in that range less
than three hours ago. I don&rsquo;t know anything
about ships, but fires are another matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This yacht seems to be the original question
mark,&rdquo; said Bill gloomily. &ldquo;But in spite of it,
we do know three things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the people on board left in a hurry,
and left not more than a couple of hours ago.&mdash;What&rsquo;s
the third?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that they were so keen on hiding the
name of this craft that they either destroyed or
took with them everything that could identify
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so. It sure is confusing. Everything
was all right on board at breakfast time,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you fathom that one?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Osceola took up a large bowl from a table-rack.
&ldquo;Taste that.&rdquo; He pointed to a cream-colored,
doughy mass in the bottom.</p>
<p>Bill dipped in a forefinger and brought it to
his mouth. &ldquo;Wheat cakes!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it. The cook doesn&rsquo;t feed the men
wheat cakes knowing the ship is going to be
abandoned shortly. They&rsquo;re too much trouble
to make in a rush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Osceola looked pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always knew you Carlisle lads were a wide-awake
bunch,&rdquo; grinned Bill. &ldquo;Anything more,
Mister Holmes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is, big boy&mdash;even if they do turn
out real live kidders at Annapolis! I don&rsquo;t
know what time the ship was abandoned, but the
cook left this kitchen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Galley&mdash;&rdquo; corrected his friend, with a wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cook left this <i>galley</i>&mdash;&rdquo; Osceola continued,
&ldquo;shortly after breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, he&rsquo;d washed the griddle&mdash;it&rsquo;s
hanging up over there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;But he hadn&rsquo;t got to this bowl yet, or those
other dirty dishes on the table&mdash;&rdquo; Bill broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the first time in history,&rdquo; said Osceola
suavely, &ldquo;Midshipman William Bolton, U.S.N.,
Second Class, and all the rest of it, shows a
decided glimmer of almost human intelligence!
&lsquo;Sing ho, the jolly maiden and the tar&rsquo;&mdash;or
words to that effect . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill saluted. &ldquo;And seeing there&rsquo;s no maiden,
the tar suggests we beat it out of here before the
famous Seminole Chief goes completely nerts!
That door across the passage is marked &lsquo;Engine
Room&mdash;Keep Out.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, naturally, we&rsquo;ll go in,&rdquo; laughed Osceola,
and leaving the galley, he swung open the
door.</p>
<p>The two stepped onto a metal grating. A steel
ladder led down to the floor of the engine room
ten feet below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait here while I have a looksee,&rdquo; suggested
Bill, and he ran lightly down the ladder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>From his stand on the grating, Osceola
watched him make a hurried inspection of the
main engines. &ldquo;Diesels,&rdquo; he called up, &ldquo;they
are certainly big ones&mdash;but there&rsquo;s not a blooming
thing wrong so far as I can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stayed below for about ten minutes, then
joined Osceola above. &ldquo;The machinery&rsquo;s all
in running order,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>The young Indian suddenly raised a hand to
his lips, cutting Bill short. He tiptoed across
the grating and into the passage, and presently
beckoned Bill forward, cautioning silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody on deck!&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;He walked across that passage one flight up
just now, and went on deck over on the side by
the captain&rsquo;s cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly have a pair of ears,&rdquo; murmured
Bill. &ldquo;I never caught a sound. Are you
sure it wasn&rsquo;t a cat or a dog that got left behind?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dog nothing! My ancestry and early upbringing
have been more or less of a hindrance
in this white man&rsquo;s country&mdash;but when it comes
to distinguishing sounds, Bill, I&rsquo;m one hundred
per cent. Those were the footsteps of a human
being. He knows we are down here, whoever
he is&mdash;and he doesn&rsquo;t want us to know he&rsquo;s
aboard, or he&rsquo;d have come into the open long
before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get after him then, and find out
why he&rsquo;s hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. But let me go first. I&rsquo;ve had more
experience in tracking than you. Better take
off your shoes. This is a ticklish business and
it&rsquo;s more than likely he&rsquo;s armed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola waited until Bill was in his stocking
feet with his shoes tied together and hanging
about his neck. Then he passed up the stair to
the passage that led to the deck like a stealthy
shadow, with the young aviator at his heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>After pausing to make sure the way was clear,
the two went out on deck. Osceola seemed at a
loss for an instant, then started aft, motioning
Bill to follow. He walked with his body bent
forward so as to keep below the level of the
deckhouse portholes, and darted into the main
companionway. Then without the slightest
hesitation he entered a large cabin on his right,
evidently the main salon. For a moment, he
gazed about, then he sprang back into the passage,
pushing Bill ahead of him.</p>
<p>While his friend watched, Osceola did a peculiar
thing. He dropped to the floor and
wormed his way along the passage wall until he
could peer round the open door. His hand, with
the automatic revolver in it, came forward, and
trained the gun on someone within the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re covered,&rdquo; he said in his deep voice,
&ldquo;come out from under that couch&mdash;and come
pronto! <i>Or I&rsquo;ll fire!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter II</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SURPRISED</span></h2>
<p>Bill didn&rsquo;t care to be thrust out of danger&rsquo;s
way by Osceola. He stepped into the open doorway,
his revolver leveled. At the far end of the
yacht&rsquo;s salon, taking up the entire space across
the rear wall, stood the couch. It was so low
from the floor that he wondered not only how
a human being could squeeze beneath it, but how
Osceola could possibly have known that anyone
was hidden there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on! Get out of that!&rdquo; growled the
Seminole. &ldquo;And come out feet first, or you&rsquo;ll
stop a bullet before you leave the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t shoot!&rdquo; cried a high-pitched,
muffled voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>A pair of rubber soled sneakers appeared from
beneath the couch, soon followed by two stockinged
legs. Then while the two friends stared
in amazement a boy of possibly twelve years
wriggled forth and got to his feet. He was a
round-faced, red-headed youngster in khaki
shorts and outing shirt, and across his nose and
one side of his face he bore a great smudge of
black coal-dust. He looked hot and badly
rumpled, but did not appear to be frightened
in the least; on the contrary, he was
bursting with rage, and began to hold forth
immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, you!&rdquo; he piped in his ridiculous
treble, both hands thrust into trouser pockets
and balancing on the balls of his feet against the
roll of the ship. &ldquo;What are you fellas doin&rsquo;
here? Whose yacht do you think this is, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill and Osceola broke into roars of laughter
and holstered their automatics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what we want to know, young
bantam-cock!&rdquo; gasped Bill, when he could
speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us all about it, bub,&rdquo; seconded the chief.
&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going to hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full minute the boy stared at the two
young men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;You fellas don&rsquo;t look
like pirates!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pirates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hijackers, then, or whatever you call &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>do</i> we look like?&rdquo; asked Osceola,
smiling.</p>
<p>The boy looked puzzled. &ldquo;You came in a
plane&mdash;I saw you land&mdash;but you talk like college
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remarkable perception&mdash;&rdquo; The chief
winked at Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quit your kiddin&rsquo;&mdash;who are you guys,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill shook his head. &ldquo;Who are <i>you</i>, and what
are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you first,&rdquo; stubbornly insisted the
youngster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; laughed Bill. &ldquo;My name
is Bolton, and I&rsquo;m &lsquo;commonly known as Bill.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A college man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midshipman at the Naval Academy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t in uniform,&rdquo; said the boy doubtfully.
&ldquo;How do you happen to be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I change my clothes occasionally. And
this is my second class summer&mdash;I&rsquo;m on leave.
Anything else you&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;heaps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Bill drew a deep breath, &ldquo;I was born
an orphan at the age of five, and until I was
ninety-seven I could only go upstairs backward
with my hair parted on the side&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raspberries!&rdquo; flashed back redhead. &ldquo;Come
on, who&rsquo;s the other fella? I&rsquo;ll bet six bits his
middle name is Mussolini!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;The other fella, as you so elegantly put it,
is Chief Osceola, Grand Sachem of the Seminole
Nation and a senior at Carlisle. And incidentally,
neither Chief Osceola nor myself permit
grubby little schoolboys to get fresh when we&rsquo;re
around.&rdquo; Bill shot out a long arm and gathered
in the urchin. &ldquo;Will you scalp him, Osceola?&rdquo;
he inquired solemnly. &ldquo;Or shall I lay him
across my knee and give him what he&rsquo;s asking
for? Stop wriggling, you young ruffian, or
you&rsquo;ll get a double dose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Mister Bolton&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be
fresh&mdash;really, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; The youngster was
all contrition now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then snap out of it, and answer <i>our</i> questions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, sir, I will&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off and stared
up at Bill, awe and amazement written on his
round face. &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he fairly shouted. &ldquo;You
must be the two guys I read about in the newspaper.
The ones that busted up that gang of
gunmen down in Florida a couple of weeks
ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; Bill released him. &ldquo;That
doesn&rsquo;t give you license to show off your bad
manners, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! And to think I was trying to
get fresh with a couple of real men like you!
I&rsquo;m darned sorry&mdash;and I apologize, Mr. Bolton,
and to you, too, Chief Osceola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, kid. No harm done,&rdquo;
laughed Osceola. &ldquo;Quit stalling and tell us
something about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m Charlie Evans,&rdquo; returned the
boy, still awestruck at his discovery of their
identity. &ldquo;My father is C. B. Evans. We live
in Boston, and this is our yacht, the <i>Merrymaid</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill walked over to the divan and sat down,
while Osceola leaned against the arm of a chair.
&ldquo;Come over here, Charlie,&rdquo; he invited, &ldquo;and
tell me how it happens that we find you alone
on this yacht. Chief Osceola and I are on our
way from Miami to New York. We sighted
the <i>Merrymaid</i> adrift and evidently abandoned
out here, so we naturally landed to investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, that was fine of you!&rdquo; Charlie curled
up on the couch beside him. &ldquo;But you see, I
can&rsquo;t very well tell you what happened, because
I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; Osceola&rsquo;s voice sounded
rather gruff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Charlie,&rdquo; cut in Bill. &ldquo;This is a
serious matter. We&rsquo;ve got to be on our way soon.
You are wasting our time and your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie flushed. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t kidding you, Mr.
Bolton, really I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there must have been a crew and passengers
aboard this ship. Do you mean to say
that they disappeared into thin air and you don&rsquo;t
know why or how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I do. You see, I went below to the
trunk room after breakfast. When I came on
deck again, there wasn&rsquo;t a soul in sight. I
searched the yacht, but you fellas are the first
people I&rsquo;ve seen since I came up on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;d better start at the beginning,&rdquo;
said Osceola. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask questions and you answer
them. And maybe we&rsquo;ll be able to get
somewhere. Suppose you tell us where this
yacht was going and who were aboard her at
breakfast time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; returned young Evans. &ldquo;We
were out of Boston, bound for Savannah. Dad
had business there, so he took Mother and me
and Uncle Arthur along. Uncle Arthur is
Mother&rsquo;s brother, you know. The four of us
had breakfast together at eight o&rsquo;clock, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woa, not so fast. I suppose somebody
skippered this boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Captain Ridley is skipper.
I forgot to say that he had breakfast with us, too.
And we carry a pretty big crew. I can&rsquo;t tell
you how many without counting them, but I
know all their names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola smiled at the boy&rsquo;s earnestness.
&ldquo;Never mind the crew, now. What happened
after breakfast? I take it everything was running
as usual up to that time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right, chief. Well, you see, after
breakfast, I wanted to practice that slow drop
Harold Lane told me about. You see, I pitch on
our team. So I asked Uncle Arthur if he would
catch for me. He said he would, so we went
out on deck&mdash;but say&mdash;Uncle Arthur can&rsquo;t catch
for nuts! He muffed the very first ball, and it
went overboard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t pitch balls,&rdquo; interrupted Bill.
&ldquo;Strikes are what make a pitcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s kidding now?&rdquo; said Charlie delightedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; Osceola broke in, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cross examining
this witness. Don&rsquo;t listen to him Charlie.
What did you do after the ball was lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went into my cabin, but I couldn&rsquo;t find
another one there. Then I remembered that I
had one in my trunk&mdash;so I went below to get
it. Well, when I got the trunk open, I got interested
in some things I found that I didn&rsquo;t
know I&rsquo;d brought with me&mdash;and I guess I stayed
down there for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About how long, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, something over an hour, maybe. I came
across a book I like, and got to reading it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know the ship had stopped moving?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but that was nothing. I mean,
father often has her stopped on a hot day, and
goes overboard for a swim. I do, too, and so
does Uncle Arthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;and when you came upstairs
again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One says topside or above on shipboard,&rdquo;
suggested Bill, winking at Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-and likewise-K,&rdquo; replied Osceola. &ldquo;Not
that it has a thing to do with the matter in hand.
Now, Charlie, when you came&mdash;on deck, you
found that everybody had vanished&mdash;that you
were alone on board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. And believe me but I was some
scared! I went all over the ship, but even the
cat had gone. And, well&mdash;I guess you men
won&rsquo;t tell on a fella&mdash;I came in here, and I guess
I cried some&mdash;&rdquo; He ended shame-facedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you did! I would probably have
done the same thing in your place!&rdquo; Bill encouraged
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Charlie looked relieved. &ldquo;Gee whiz, but it
was lonesome!&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;I hung round
a bit, didn&rsquo;t know just what to do. Then I
thought of sending out a call for help. I know
the International Morse Code. But when I
got to the radio room&mdash;someone had put the
darn thing on the fritz. Wouldn&rsquo;t that jar
yuh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty tough!&rdquo; agreed Bill. &ldquo;What next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I kind of nosed around. Thought
Dad or Mother might have left a note or something
for me. I couldn&rsquo;t find anything, though.
Gosh, it was so quiet! Then I made myself a
couple of sandwiches and ate half a plum cake
I found in the pantry, and felt better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that, I hunted some more, but it
wasn&rsquo;t any use. I heard your plane about that
time. I didn&rsquo;t know who you were, of course,
so I decided I&rsquo;d better lay low until I could size
up what kind of guys you were. Oh, Mr. Bolton&mdash;can&rsquo;t
you find Mother and Dad for me?&rdquo;
Charlie&rsquo;s voice broke suddenly and he sounded
very much like a lost small boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Just then Osceola raised a warning hand.
&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a rush of feet on deck. Before
the three in the salon could reach for revolvers,
men with leveled rifles appeared at every porthole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick &rsquo;em up and keep &rsquo;em there!&rdquo; cracked
a voice from the open doorway, and a man in the
smart white uniform of a ship&rsquo;s officer strode
into the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter III</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MAN OVERBOARD</span></h2>
<p>The man who entered so abruptly was a tall,
heavy-set individual in the early thirties. Blond
as only the Scandinavians or North Germans
are blond, his very next words betrayed Teutonic
origin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he sneered as the three kept their hands
level with their ears. &ldquo;A boy and two half-grown
men. Master Evans, and a pair of
aviators, eh? The one, we miss the first time.
The others descend on us like manna out of
heaven,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think! Three more mouths
to feed and no money in it for anyone. <i>Donnerwetter,
noch ein Mahl!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nichts kom heraus, mahogany bedstead,&rdquo;
piped Charlie. The added danger seemed
to revive his waning spirits with a vengeance.
&ldquo;The same to you and many of &rsquo;em, Dutchy.
I know some more, too,&rdquo; he went on proudly.
&ldquo;Schweitzerk&auml;se, frankfurters and getthe-Houtofhere!
That last is the longest word in
the Heinie dictionary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the shortest?&rdquo; inquired Bill, who
was enjoying this byplay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;but the one they say
the quickest is &lsquo;camerad.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Halts &rsquo;maul!</i> Shut up, I mean!&rdquo; thundered
the blond stranger. The whites around
the pupils of his light blue eyes became bloodshot
with anger. &ldquo;I am master here,&rdquo; he roared.
&ldquo;<i>Silence!</i> I will have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two sailors appeared in the doorway behind
him. He wheeled about. &ldquo;Adolph, you will
keep the prisoners covered. Hans, take their
weapons from them. And now,&rdquo; he continued,
when the three lowered their hands after they
had been searched, &ldquo;you will tell me what names
you go by.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Charlie sprang to his feet and made a stiff,
military bow. &ldquo;The dark gentleman over
yonder,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;is traveling incognito.
So that you will not be confused by false
appearances, I will breathe his secret. He is
no less a personage than His Majesty, George
the Fifth! Beside me on this couch is Mary,
the Four-Fifths, and I am Herbert Hoover!&mdash;Oh,
Doctor, why so angry? You may call me
Herbie if you&rsquo;re good!&rdquo; He finished in falsetto,
with rolling eyes toward Bill and Osceola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ruhig!</i> Silence!&rdquo; shouted the exasperated
officer, while Bill and Osceola were convulsed
with laughter at his fury. &ldquo;Hans&mdash;take this
devil-child on deck and keep him there until I
come. If he offers more insolence, give him a
taste of your belt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, you can&rsquo;t please the Doctor,&rdquo; protested
Charlie with an air of injured innocence
as he was led forth. &ldquo;He asked for the go-by, so
I gave it to him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The stranger waved him away. &ldquo;Now, you
two will tell me who you are,&rdquo; he commanded.
&ldquo;From American children one expects insolence&mdash;with
you, it is different. Your names at once,
if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Bolton.&rdquo; Bill saw no reason
for hiding his identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;am Osceola, Chief
of the Seminoles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; mused their captor. &ldquo;The two young
fellows that were mixed up in the Shell Island
business. <i>So!</i>&rdquo; He pronounced the last word
as though it were spelled with a Z. Then for
a minute or so he appeared lost in thought.
Neither Bill nor Osceola uttered a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&mdash;&mdash;It shall be done.&rdquo; Apparently the
blond man had arrived at an important decision.
&ldquo;I am the Baron von Hiemskirk. And remember,
both of you&mdash;my word is the law. I am in
command. You will earn your keep. <i>Ja</i>, you
will be put to work and it will be well to remember
that my discipline is that of the Imperial
Navy. You will obey all orders&mdash;on the
jump!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the alternative?&rdquo; Bill rose to his feet.</p>
<p>The baron stuck a single eyeglass in his eye
and stared at Bill with an evil smile on his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are now about sixty miles off the coast
of North America,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;It is a long
swim, my young friend. Come now&mdash;we will
go on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode out of the room, and Bill and Osceola
followed him, with a look of mutual
understanding. The sailor brought up the rear.</p>
<p>Charlie called to them from the rail. &ldquo;Say,
look what I&rsquo;ve found! That&rsquo;s what took Mother
and Dad and everybody off of here while I was
in the trunk room. Hans says they&rsquo;re going to
take us too. I don&rsquo;t care what happens now,
I&rsquo;ll be with Dad and Mother&mdash;but it&rsquo;s pretty
tough on you fellows! Say, you wouldn&rsquo;t think
these Heinies had brains enough to run one of
those things, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved excitedly overside, and the two
friends saw the long gray hull and conning tower
of a submarine moored beside the yacht.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The baron, who had stopped to speak to a
young officer, walked over to the boy and caught
him roughly by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil-child!&rdquo; he roared in his deep bass. &ldquo;I
spoke to you regarding insolence for the last
time a short while ago!&rdquo; He turned to the
officer. &ldquo;Herr Lieutenant!&rdquo; he commanded.
&ldquo;Take this boy forward and see that he is well
punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whip, Herr Baron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten lashes&mdash;yes&mdash;and at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Zum befehl</i>, Herr Baron!&rdquo; He grabbed
Charlie&rsquo;s arm and yanked the struggling youngster
along the deck.</p>
<p>Like a flash Bill darted after them. He
caught up with the pair at the gangway, and
gripping the young officer by the collar, he
jerked him backward on to the deck. Then,
as Charlie made a dash for Osceola, he bent
down and deliberately slapped the lieutenant&rsquo;s
face with the palm of his open hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before you try to maltreat that boy, perhaps
it would be as well to settle with me,&rdquo; he
said calmly, while along the deck came the click
of the sailors&rsquo; rifles. &ldquo;That is,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;ve got the guts to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Schweinhund!</i>&rdquo; cried the enraged officer,
as he sprang to his feet. Without an instant&rsquo;s
hesitation, he swung for Bill&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>The useful art of self-defense is well taught
at the Naval Academy, and Bill had ever been
a proficient pupil. He jerked back his head,
dodging the man&rsquo;s fist by a hair&rsquo;s breadth. Then
as the other overbalanced, he stepped in with a
short-arm jab to his opponent&rsquo;s kidneys. This
he followed up immediately with a powerful
left hook to the point of the jaw, and the Herr
Lieutenant went crashing overside, through the
ropes of the gangway. There came the dull
thud of his head as it struck the metal side of the
submarine, and he disappeared down the narrow
strip of water between the vessels. Immediately
Bill dived after him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>His lithe body cut the surface with hardly a
splash, and he shot into the cool green depths
from his twenty foot dive with eyes wide
open. To right and to left dark blurs of the
vessels&rsquo; hulls shadowed the translucent green.
No other objects met his searching gaze, so using
a powerful breast stroke, he forged further
downward. All at once he saw something grayish
white below. His lungs were bursting with
lack of air and the heavy water pressure at this
depth. It grew icy cold, but he continued to
strain onward, backing his muscles with an indomitable
force of will.</p>
<p>The white spot beneath him was taking shape
now&mdash;surely the linen uniform of the unlucky
lieutenant. Yes, there he was, sinking face
down, arms and legs spread-eagled and useless,
the wind knocked out of him by the double blow
of Bill&rsquo;s fists and the crash against the submarine
side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Bill caught the sprawling, inert figure, with a
cupped hand beneath the chin. Instantly his legs
and free arm got into action again, but heading
this time in the opposite direction. Up shot the
drowning man and his rescuer. Bill&rsquo;s head was
whirling, his faculties were leaving him. The
man would sink again if he lost his hold. Slipping
the crook of his elbow beneath the unconscious
lieutenant&rsquo;s chin, he held his head close to
his side. Would they never reach the surface&mdash;and
air? What if his own unprotected skull
should strike the bulging curve of a vessel&rsquo;s
hull? Sharp pain stabbed him between the eyes&mdash;he
knew no more.</p>
<p>Far away&mdash;fathoms above him&mdash;Bill heard
a voice calling his name. He seemed to be floating
upward in a sea-green haze, but there was air
at last&mdash;heaven-sent air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming round now,&rdquo; said the voice,
which sounded like Osceola&rsquo;s, and much nearer
than before. &ldquo;No wonder he went out&mdash;under
water nearly two minutes and a half! How&rsquo;s
the other fellow, Baron?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Fritz!&rdquo; Surely this was the blond
commander speaking and his voice seemed much
louder and closer at hand than that of the young
chief. And as the words grew more distinct,
their meaning impressed itself on Bill&rsquo;s dawning
consciousness. &ldquo;Poor Fritz!&rdquo; repeated the
baron. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the water out of him now
and he will live&mdash;but it will be a touch and go
for some time. The poor lad has a bad case of
concussion. I can&rsquo;t tell whether his skull is
fractured, but I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got an awful crack on the back of his
head, but you can&rsquo;t hold that up against Bill
Bolton,&rdquo; returned Osceola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, my dear chap. I assure you I hold
no grudge at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something has happened, thought Bill, to
alter Osceola&rsquo;s status with the Baron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you to know, my dear Chief, that both
Fritz and I are sportsmen. Blows were struck in
fair fight. When Fritz hit the submarine, I
could have killed young Bolton without hesitation.
But when he dived after my cousin&mdash;I
loved the lad. It was splendid&mdash;<i>colossal</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you feel that way,&rdquo; Osceola remarked.
&ldquo;Things were getting a bit strained,
I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know that. But I have had a terrible
day, my friend. That devil-child put my
temper on edge. And a dozen wildcats are as
nothing to the boy&rsquo;s mother when she found
we&rsquo;d left him behind. God be thanked, that
is over. I cannot let you and Bolton continue
your journey at present, but at least you
will live well, and have an interesting time. In
saving the life of Fritz, you two have rendered
me a service. Karl von Hiemskirk does not forget
such favors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for dragging me in,&rdquo; laughed Osceola.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah! You dived in after them while my
men looked on like half-wits!&rdquo; bridled the
Baron. &ldquo;You brought these two unconscious
fellows to the surface! I call that a very great
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Bill heard him sigh, but although he was now
fully awake, he kept his eyes closed and listened
attentively to the Baron&rsquo;s next words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing of great importance that is worrying
me is that Fritz was first pilot of my command.
I, myself, am an aviator, a combat flyer,
who had the great honor to be a member of what
you call the circus of the unsurpassed Graf von
Richthofen, of glorious memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill opened his eyes to find himself on the
<i>Merrymaid&rsquo;s</i> deck. He sat up and began to
speak rapidly. &ldquo;Richthofen was undoubtedly
the greatest air strategean who ever flew,&rdquo; he declared,
&ldquo;they tell me that his combat formations
and the battle manoeuvers of his famous circus
have never been improved upon. Sorry I wasn&rsquo;t
old enough then to take a crack at you myself&mdash;you
must be a humdinger, Baron, when it comes
to this flying game! If you want to use my
bus and friend Fritz is temporarily out of the
picture&mdash;why not fly her yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola put his arm about Bill&rsquo;s shoulders,
and the Baron bowed from the waist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, indeed, my dear young friend,&rdquo;
he said formally, &ldquo;both for your eulogy of my
long-time-dead friend von Richthofen, and because,
after stunning my cousin, you had the
courage and graciousness to save his life at risk
of your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Bill colored a dusky red.
&ldquo;Or I shall have to pass out a second time.&rdquo;
With the chief&rsquo;s help he rose and held out his
hand. The Baron shook it heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will let our has-beens be never-wases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help overhearing what you said to
Osceola when I was regaining consciousness,&rdquo;
went on Bill. &ldquo;So as long as you can&rsquo;t see your
way clear to letting us go, I&rsquo;ll do my best to be
peaceable in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say nothing more about it, my boy.&rdquo; The
Baron fairly oozed urbanity. &ldquo;<i>Es tut mer sehr
leid</i>, I mean, it makes me very sorry to have to
detail you chaps, but it is the fate of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill and Osceola looked their surprise.
&ldquo;War?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have to inform you that my command is at
war with society. I can not allow my liking for
individuals to deter me from my aim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; inquired Osceola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will talk of that later. Now, there is
work to be done. Too much time has been
wasted already. I need an airplane pilot, Bolton,
because with my multitudinous duties, it is
impossible for me always to handle the controls.
I will make you two what you Americans call
a proposition. You will fly where and when I
tell you, Bolton. You will give me your word
of honor to do that and no more. The chief here
will also be given congenial duties. Obey my
commands and you need not give your parole&mdash;there
is no escape except by air and that will be
circumnavigated by your word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can sure use big words, Baron,&rdquo; observed
a much subdued Charlie, who had been
silently taking in the conversation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; the Baron smiled, &ldquo;but if you will
take my advice, such things are better left unsaid.
Your tongue has already got you and a
number of others into trouble today.&rdquo; He turned
again to Bill. &ldquo;I am awaiting your decision,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;the alternative in this case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and the chief will be kept prisoners
until such time as I can negotiate your ransoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill looked at Osceola, who nodded slightly.
&ldquo;All right, then, Baron, I promise to fly your
planes as you dictate, but I suspect that your
war is nothing more than hijacking on a big
scale. And I&rsquo;m hanged if I have anything to do
with that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron bowed. &ldquo;It is a bargain. I will
now conclude my work on this vessel. Fritz has
already been taken aboard the other craft, and
when I am through here, Chief Osceola will go
in her with me and my men. You, Bolton, will
follow us with Charlie, in your amphibian.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; returned Bill with Naval
Academy crispness, now that he had recognized
the baron as his superior officer. &ldquo;You will keep
above surface, I suppose, otherwise, I am likely
to loose your ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; broke in Charlie the
irrepressible. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going in the air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The air? Don&rsquo;t be silly, kid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the silly one&mdash;&rdquo; retorted the youngster.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right, ain&rsquo;t I, Baron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That submarine is an invention of my own,&rdquo;
declared the commander. &ldquo;The boy speaks
correctly. I shall <i>fly</i> her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter IV</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">VANDALS OF THE HIGH SEAS</span></h2>
<p>An hour later, Charlie sat aboard Bill&rsquo;s amphibian
which now lay moored to a sea-anchor a
quarter of a mile to leeward of the <i>Merrymaid</i>.
A hundred yards from the plane, the gray submarine
rocked gently to a long Atlantic ground
swell. Charlie, a pair of field glasses glued to
his eyes, focussed them alternately on the yacht
and on the deck of the submarine which was
crowded with men.</p>
<p>The object of all this interest was a group of
three aboard the <i>Merrymaid</i>&mdash;three men and a
youth. Left on board the vessel with a boat
wherewith to make their escape, these men were
to open the seacocks of the fated ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>In the side of every vessel, somewhat below
the waterline is a large circular manhole, two
or more feet in diameter into which fits a steel
plate or plug. The plate is fastened to the reinforced
sides of the ship by means of bolts arranged
at intervals of a few inches around the
circumference of the hole. Into this plate fit
large pipes which, communicating with the sea,
form an intake for salt water. This plug and
its manhole are together called the ship&rsquo;s seacocks.</p>
<p>Opening a ship&rsquo;s seacocks is a feat of not a
little skill and danger. The nuts of the bolts
which fasten the plate to its manhole must be
unscrewed in such a manner that the plate
loosens suddenly and not gradually, so that the
sailor who opens it may work until the last minute
and then escape from the inrushing water.
To do this, special strategy is necessary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The men from the submarine went about the
operation in the following way: Early that
morning when the <i>Merrymaid</i> was first captured,
some men were sent down into her hold to
begin preliminary work on the seacocks. Two
of these men carefully unscrewed one rusty nut
at a time, thoroughly greased its threads, and
then screwed it back into place again before
loosening the next. While this was being done,
the other men unbolted the pipes leading into
the seacock and removed all obstructions in the
way of hasty escape from its neighborhood.</p>
<p>This preliminary work of greasing and
loosening was done merely in order that the seacocks
might be in readiness for immediate opening
without loss of time should an enemy appear
or other emergency require hasty action. The
seacocks thus greased and disencumbered of
pipes and impediments were then left in place,
and the men returned to the submarine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The men who had accomplished this work
were now aboard the fated yacht once more to
finish the opening of her seacocks. With them
were Bill Bolton and the Baron. Bill, who had
had never witnessed this particular operation before,
though heartily condoning the act, was
deeply interested. Knowing that he was a midshipman
on summer leave from the United
States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Baron
von Hiemskirk permitted him to remain as a
responsible party.</p>
<p>The Baron, a sailor and Bill stood on deck
while another seaman named Muller, a strong,
heavy-faced fellow who made a specialty of
this work, climbed down to the seacock,
equipped with a monkey wrench and a sledge
hammer. Around his waist was tied a rope, the
other end of which was held by the three above
for use in emergency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Muller, under direction of the Baron, took
off the nuts from every second bolt in the circle.
Being recently loosened and greased, this was
easily done. After he had gone completely
around the circumference of the plate, the plug
was being held by only half its former number
of bolts. Beginning once more, the adroit seaman
again removed every second nut, from the
remaining bolts. The plate was now held by
only one-fourth the original number of bolts.
This process of halving was continued until the
plug was finally being held by only two bolts on
diametrically opposite sides of the circumference
of the seacock. By this time, the pressure
of the water outside was meeting with so little
resistance that the plate was bending slightly
inward, letting water spurt between the
rubber packing and the steel plate up into the
hold.</p>
<p>Muller, sweating in every pore, now thrust
his wrench into his overalls pocket, picked up his
sledge, and called out: &ldquo;Ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At his signal, the men on deck took in the
slack of the rope so that if necessary they could
hoist the imperilled seaman up out of danger.</p>
<p>Muller now lifted his sledge hammer, took
accurate aim, and with a single vigorous blow,
smashed one of the two protruding bolts through
its nut and hole. As the plate did not fly loose,
he let the heavy hammer fall again, throwing
all his strength into the blow, this time upon
the remaining bolt. With a dull explosion, the
whole two-foot plate flew loose, and a geyser of
sea water gushed upward into the hold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Muller at once leaped for the ladder and, still
holding the sledge, clambered to safety. Had
he slipped, or been washed away by the force of
the water, his comrades on deck would have
fished him up by means of the rope.</p>
<p>By this time the yacht was rapidly filling. As
the doors through all compartments had previously
been opened, the water coming through
this one seacock at once began flowing to all
parts of the hold. The men on deck were now
in real danger, for a sudden listing of the vessel,
or its unexpectedly rapid sinking might mean
their death.</p>
<p>All, therefore, at once scrambled overside to
their boat, the Baron last of all, and pulled away
as quickly as possible, lest they be sucked into
the vortex of the sinking ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>For a short space the <i>Merrymaid</i> settled
rapidly, giving the watchers reason to expect
her to go to the bottom within fifteen or twenty
minutes. Their expectations, however, were
not realized, for the ship soon began to rest at
the same level.</p>
<p>The Baron turned to Bill. &ldquo;Doubtless air
has lodged in the tops of compartments and is
imprisoned elsewhere. She must ultimately go
down, of course, but there is no telling how long
it will take&mdash;and I am in a hurry to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, use dynamite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We&rsquo;ve got sufficient here in the boat,
for such an emergency. We&rsquo;ll row back now,
and get busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dynamite was presently placed at the base
of the ship&rsquo;s two masts and amidships, and the
fuses lit. They then rowed swiftly away, and
had hardly reached a position where they would
be out of danger, when the explosion came.
Three crashes, one after the other, shattered the
sides and decks of the vessel. The <i>Merrymaid</i>
was sinking rapidly. First her bow filled; then
the gallant yacht stood perpendicularly on her
prow, and slid with a rush out of sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>At the instant her funnel plunged under, a
final tremendous explosion took place, throwing
a cloud of steam and water high into the
air. A moment later, only a vortex of oily,
tossing water gave evidence that a million dollar
yacht had gone to the bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dirty shame!&rdquo; Bill spat the words
without caring whether the Baron took umbrage
or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; that blond giant answered
seriously. &ldquo;But this is war, remember. I cannot
use her, still less can I afford to have her
discovered. Yes, it is a shame. Vandalism, if
you like, but none the less, a necessity.&rdquo; The
Baron shook his head, then went on pompously:
&ldquo;An hour ago that splendid little ship might
have been of great service to mankind. Now
she is no more. Let it be her epitaph that she
was fulfilling her destiny, with work well done.
May the world say the same of me when I have
gone to the eternal reward.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Bill kept silent and managed to conceal his
disgust. He did not appreciate such philosophizing.
Neither could he agree with the
Baron&rsquo;s estimate of his own worth. His work
might be well done, but in itself piracy on the
high seas could hardly be called more than a disgraceful
profession. Bill began to realize that
the commander&rsquo;s brain, although active enough,
was more than slightly warped.</p>
<p>They rowed over the spot where the <i>Merrymaid</i>
had gone down, and looked about for any
stray bits of wreckage which might have floated
to the surface. They found none, so made for
the amphibian at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will wait until you see us take off before
you do the same, Mr. Bolton,&rdquo; directed the
Baron with a return of his superior-officer manner,
as Bill boarded the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir. Any further orders?&rdquo; Bill
returned the military manner with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You will follow my craft as though
you were number two of a patrol. Land when I
land, and taxi over for further instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pleasant flight, Bolton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Baron. The same to you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat moved off in the direction of the
submarine and Bill climbed into his fore cockpit.
Charlie was already in his place in the rear
cockpit, and Bill noticed that he seemed
strangely quiet, almost sullen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s eating you, old boy?&rdquo; Bill turned
round to face him, then added kindly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
blame you for feeling low. It&rsquo;s hard lines about
the <i>Merrymaid</i>. Made me feel rotten myself.
Nastier piece of vandalism was never committed.
But you mustn&rsquo;t take it out on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought you and the chief were my
friends,&rdquo; began Charlie aggrievedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are&mdash;what makes you think we&rsquo;re
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you saved me a hiding&mdash;and
risked your life for that pirate. That was a
bully thing to do, but now you and Chief Osceola
have joined up with them and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;How come&mdash;joined up with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, didn&rsquo;t I hear you, myself, tell the
Baron you would work for him&mdash;do exactly
what he told you to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; Bill&rsquo;s laugh was without
humor. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no good reason why I should
explain my actions to you, but I like you,
Charlie, and I&rsquo;m sorry for you into the bargain.
Now, pin back your ears&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m listening!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, before I tell you what&rsquo;s what, I want
your promise to keep your mouth shut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie produced a packet of gum. He tossed
Bill a stick and began to munch another.
&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said earnestly, his eyes on the older
lad&rsquo;s, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you might have guessed it&mdash;but
neither Osceola nor myself have gone in
with these pirates. I gave the Baron my word
to obey orders&mdash;but only so far as they have
to do with driving his planes. It was either that
or being locked up&mdash;and cutting out any chance
there might be to escape. It&rsquo;s the same with Osceola.
He saw my scheme quick as winking&mdash;which
is more than you did&mdash;but then, you&rsquo;re
just a kid, of course.&rdquo; Bill&rsquo;s eyes twinkled as
he saw the boy&rsquo;s discomfiture, but he went on
more seriously. &ldquo;The Baron is so sure of himself
and his strong organization that he has no
fear that we two can do anything to hinder his
plans. But unless we&rsquo;re allowed some freedom,
don&rsquo;t you see, Osceola and I might just as well
have given up before we started?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie was profoundly interested and
ashamed of himself. &ldquo;Gee, I was a pill, all
right. But, Bill&mdash;do you really think the three
of us could break up the gang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you never can tell till you try,&rdquo; Bill
answered. &ldquo;First of all, we must pretend to
work in with this bunch of sea bandits&mdash;do our
best not to arouse their suspicions, you know.
Then, when we learn more about them and their
ways of doing business, it will be time enough to
start planning on our own account.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. And don&rsquo;t you worry. I&rsquo;ll
keep quiet. I wouldn&rsquo;t breathe a word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t, kid&mdash;not even to your dad
and mother when you see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross my heart&mdash;hope to die if I do, Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, then. And always remember
that it&rsquo;s the three of us against a great big
organization. A single slip on our part&mdash;and
well, so far as we&rsquo;re concerned, it would be just
too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my promise, Bill. Any idea where
these pirates have their hangout? Where we
are bound for now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some hideout on the coast, I suppose.
Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if maybe it was somewhere in
Pamlico or Albemarle Sound. There used
to be lots of pirates in those waters long ago, before
the Revolution, I mean. There&rsquo;s a book
at home, tells all about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Times have changed a lot since then,&rdquo; mused
Bill, &ldquo;and piracy, too, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve a base of some
kind over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill was facing forward now, staring steadily
out over the water. &ldquo;Something quite different,
Charlie,&rdquo; he muttered; and then in a sharp
tone that made the boy start&mdash;&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the way
they work it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; Charlie craned his neck and
gazed in the same direction. &ldquo;The submarine&rsquo;s
sprouting wings!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter V</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TRANSFORMATION OF A SEA MONSTER</span></h2>
<p>The two lads, Bill and Charlie, stared with
undivided attention at the astonishing spectacle.
Two large fins which evidently had been lying
close to the submarine&rsquo;s sides, were rising into
the air. With a speed that seemed remarkable
these fins reached a vertical position. For a
moment they remained pointing straight toward
the high blue arc of the heavens. Then they
swung outward, lowering horizontally from the
ship&rsquo;s sides, to come to rest when level with the
deck, and about five feet above the surface of the
water&mdash;a complete set of airplane wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, she&rsquo;s a monoplane now!&rdquo; exclaimed
Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder how they&rsquo;ll produce a tail unit?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean a rudder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That, together with a stabilizer, fin
and elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before the words were well out of Bill&rsquo;s
mouth, the miracle occurred. A large rudder
lifted itself out of the water, and opening out
as it came to rest, seemed to sprout like a giant
seabud into a complete tail group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can she use the water propeller in the air?&rdquo;
Charlie kept his eyes glued on the submarine.
&ldquo;It seems to me that would hardly be big enough
to fly with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly. That outfit is the queerest engineering
jumble I&rsquo;ve ever seen. But unless the
Herr Baron can work absolute miracles, it will
take more than one motor and propeller to move
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The submarine lay to windward of the amphibian.
The lads therefore obtained a stern
view of the ship and it was difficult for them
to see exactly what was going on forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Suddenly Charlie raised another shout.
&ldquo;Look, Bill, look! Here comes the motor.
Some jack-in-the-box, I call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another one! And still another!
Gee-jumpin&rsquo;-gee-roosalem&mdash;the
blamed thing is coughing up motors like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a cat with the belly-ache,&rdquo; suggested
Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inelegant, but apt. Let&rsquo;s see, there are one,
two . . . <i>five</i> of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some packet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some packet is right. I&rsquo;d pay admission to
see this any day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The reason for this excited dialogue had been,
first, the raising of that section of the deck between
the two great wing sections until from
wing-tip to wing-tip, one continuous horizontal
plane was formed. Next, up through what was
probably a hatch in this center wing section,
though of course invisible at that distance from
the lads, appeared an airplane motor. This rose
on its own engine struts, slid to starboard along
the wing and came to rest. Another made its
appearance and moved to starboard in line with
the first. The next two found places on the port
wing, and the last engine remained directly
above the hatch which probably closed with a
sliding cover. Then the mechanics came topside,
through another hatchway, bearing propellers
which were fitted to the engines, fore
and aft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever seen two propellers
on the same engine!&rdquo; cried Charlie.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the reason for it, Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill turned round in his seat. &ldquo;Each one of
those engines, as you call them, Charlie, is a
double unit. In other words, two motors joined
together, one forward and one aft. There are
ten propellers, because there are ten motors in
that line. The propellers forward are tractors,
those aft pushers. The <i>Dornier</i>, the big German
DO-X passenger plane, has the same arrangement
of motors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess they must generate a heap of power?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty. But you need it to propel a heavy
ship like that sub. By the way, do you happen
to know what they call her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Flying Fish</i>&mdash;one of the gobs told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, where do you get that Navy stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gobs?&rdquo; Charlie chuckled. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got
a sea-goin&rsquo; dad. He had a U.S.N.R.F. commission
during the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so? Great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet yer. Say, Bill, hadn&rsquo;t you better
get our own engine going? The <i>Flying Fish</i>
will be taking off right away. She&rsquo;s a regular
monoplane now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill shook his head, and turned to face the
submarine again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t take off for a few minutes yet.
As she is, those wings will never hold her weight
in the air. And for another thing, she sets
much too low in the water to ever get off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, see, Bill&mdash;she&rsquo;s rising. She&rsquo;s getting
higher in the water all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jingoes! She is, at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do they do it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Same method as a submarine helps to raise
itself from the bottom. Water is forced out of
certain compartments and air pumped in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, it&rsquo;s a marvel! And look, there are
short wings or fins, extending from the hull
under each wing. What do they need them
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wing-strut supports, I guess. Yes, there
come the men with the struts. See how they
are securing them from the wing sections to the
fins below, and shorter ones from the fins to the
hull?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you meant when you said that
the wings of the <i>Flying Fish</i> wouldn&rsquo;t hold
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Without struts to support that
spread, the wings would surely crumple with
her weight in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess she&rsquo;s all set for the take off
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon she is. Yes, there go her motors
idling! Hear &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strap on your helmet and your goggles.
Then go forward and haul in our sea anchor.
When you get back to your cockpit, keep your
hands off the controls in there and adjust the
headphone set hanging below the instrument
board. Some day, if we ever get out of this
mess, I may give you flight instruction, but not
on this hop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And this is important&mdash;for safety&rsquo;s
sake, remember. I&rsquo;m skipper of this craft.
What I say goes&mdash;and goes with a bang.
Savez?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Charlie&rsquo;s voice was sober and
subdued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., then. Hop to it, kid, I want to get
moving.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>A very important Charlie quickly buckled
the chin-strap of his helmet and scrambled forward.
He followed directions exceedingly
well, considering the fact that he had never been
in a plane before. Once out on the nose he pulled
in the mooring line and the collapsible canvas
bucket known as the sea anchor, and carried
them back to the rear cockpit. There he stowed
them away. Back in the pilot&rsquo;s seat again, he
adjusted his goggles and the headphone set.
Then he stood up, and grasping the cockpit&rsquo;s
cowl, he leaned forward so as to watch Bill
manipulate the controls in the fore cockpit.</p>
<p>From the time that he was a little tad of a
fellow, Charlie had been crazy to fly. At home,
his bedroom was decorated with pictures of
famous flyers and their planes. He fairly ate up
airplane stories and his book shelves were
crowded with literature on flying, although he
found some of the volumes too technical. Now
that he had a chance to witness a take-off at first
hand, he wasn&rsquo;t going to miss a single detail if
he could help it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Charlie knew that the take-off includes
the handling of a plane from the time the throttle
is opened until the ship is in level flight directly
above the surface. He had also read
somewhere that in order to leave the ground or
the water, it is necessary for the plane to have
flying speed, the minimum speed at which the
lift of the wings will equal the weight; for the
object of the take-off is to gain this speed. The
plane must first be manoeuvered into an attitude
which facilitates a quick increase in speed.
It must be held in this attitude while moving
forward at an increasing rate and must finally
be taken off in such a way that it is under full
control from the instant it leaves the surface.
He also knew that <i>all take-offs must be made
directly into the wind</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The <i>Flying Fish</i> was already moving through
the water, her ten engines roaring like an express
train, when Charlie saw Bill set their own motor
idling. Rudder and ailerons were placed in
neutral and the amphibian allowed to swing
until it was headed directly into the wind. Then
Bill slowly but steadily opened wide the throttle.
At the same time, the youngster saw him pull
the stick back in order to raise their bow out of
the water. This he knew was necessary, both
to gain planing speed and to keep the propeller
out of the spray which might damage it.</p>
<p>Six or eight seconds after opening the throttle,
with the bow well up and the amphibian
gaining momentum every instant, Bill pushed
the stick all the way forward, and did so in
order to raise the tail and depress the nose. But
as the plane was moving at some speed, the bow
could not be pushed down into the water. Instead,
the speed at which they were taxying
gradually forced it upward until they were
skimming the surface on their step. Bill then
eased the stick back to neutral and maintained
it there while speed was being gathered. Spray
was dashing against Charlie&rsquo;s face and chest as
they sped along. The sensation of traveling at
terrific speed was enormous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! This sure is great!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Getting a kick out of it?&rdquo; asked a voice in
his ear, causing him almost to lose his balance.
Then he remembered the transmitter on his chest
and realized he had been talking into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure am, Bill. What&rsquo;s the next thing you
have to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next thing for <i>you</i> to do, young feller,
is to get back to your seat and buckle on your
safety-belt. If you are so keen to learn, I&rsquo;ll talk
as I run this old crate into the air, and you watch
what I&rsquo;m doing. Maybe that will keep you from
trying to climb down the back of my neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Bill, that&rsquo;ll be great. I&rsquo;ll sit tight,
honest I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then. We are skimming the surface
on the step now, as you&rsquo;ve noticed. No
more large movements of the controls may be
made, as the plane is now sensitive to them.
I&rsquo;m paying particular attention to the lateral balance
from this stage on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill stopped talking for a moment, then went
on again:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Remember this, Charlie. It&rsquo;s important.
<i>The plane must not be taken off until speed adequate
to give complete control has been attained.</i>
Any attempt on my part to pull it off
prematurely will result in a take-off at the stalling
point, where control is uncertain. Now
we&rsquo;ve gained flying speed, so I break her out of
the water with a momentary pressure on the
elevators. That pressure was very slight and I
eased it at the moment of take-off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the plane left the water, its speed was
only slightly above minimum flying speed. Any
decrease in this would naturally mean a stall.
Therefore, I&rsquo;m keeping the nose level for six to
eight seconds in order to get a safe margin above
the stalling point before beginning to climb.
Safety first always&mdash;when flying, Charlie. Now
she&rsquo;s all right, the engine&rsquo;s running smooth and
sweet. So I pull my stick back gently, and as
you see, we&rsquo;re leaving the water behind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter VI</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE RAIDER</span></h2>
<p>Half a mile or so ahead of Bill&rsquo;s plane, the
great sea monster, the <i>Flying Fish</i>, leveled off
at an altitude of twenty-five hundred feet, and
headed out on a northeasterly course.</p>
<p>Bill continued to climb his amphibian until
they too reached that height, then he spoke to
Charlie again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;re high enough, I&rsquo;ve got to
make a right turn in order to follow that ship.
So I push my stick slowly forward, drop the nose
to level like this, and maintain it there throughout
the turn. Next I give her right aileron and
increase right rudder considerably at the same
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve gone into a bank. I see.&rdquo; Charlie
unconsciously leant toward the raised wing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. And now that I&rsquo;ve tilted her far
enough, I check the wing with the ailerons, and
at the same time ease the pressure on the rudder.
I maintain a constant bank, you see, and a constant
pressure on the rudder bar throughout the
turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are round to where we want to go,
so I resume level flight by applying left aileron
and left rudder. The wings are level once more,
so I neutralize the ailerons and give her a normal
amount of right rudder. And we&rsquo;re pointed
in a direct line for the <i>Flying Fish</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, but there&rsquo;s an awful lot to it,&rdquo; muttered
Charlie into his transmitter. &ldquo;Looks so
simple and easy when you&rsquo;re on the ground,
watching a plane flying. How do you ever remember
it all?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, at first it&rsquo;s a bit confusing, until you get
the hang of the thing&mdash;but it soon becomes
second nature to do the right trick. When you
come to fly you&rsquo;ll find that there isn&rsquo;t time for
slow thinking in the air. In fact, as my instructor
used to say, a flyer must develop instinctive
coordination between the sensory organs
and the muscles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t prove it by me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it simply means that when flying a
pilot must act quicker than he can think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Like Dad does when he gets mad
and gives me a walloping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill laughed heartily. &ldquo;Hair brush or slipper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I always get the hair brush. He can
get a better grip on it. But I get a choice at
that&mdash;back or bristles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think that bristles might be the less
unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I. Just once. Never again, though.
I had to carry a pillow around with me for a
week after that session.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I,&rdquo; remarked Bill, &ldquo;had your imagination,
Charlie, I&rsquo;d be worth more than John D.
Rockefeller!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raspberries!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>For a time they kept silence, unbroken save
for the humming drone of the engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where that hideaway is we were
talking about?&rdquo; Charlie said after a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t located on our coast, if we&rsquo;re
bound there now. This plane is pointing
straight for Northern Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! Do you really think we&rsquo;re going
across&mdash;making a trans-Atlantic flight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance, kid, with the gas we&rsquo;ve got
aboard this crate. If you ask me, the <i>Flying
Fish</i> is heading for a mother ship of some sort.
This gang will have to operate from a steamer
if they have no land base. Slap on those sea
glasses you were using and take a squint dead
ahead beyond the <i>Fish</i>&mdash;Smoke on the horizon,
isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure is. Yes, I can make it out plainly now.
Say, you don&rsquo;t realize how fast we&rsquo;re traveling
until you get a bead on something in the distance.
The ship is still hull down, but the smoke
seems to be getting denser&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can see it now,&rdquo; said Bill, giving the amphibian
more altitude in order to gain a better
view. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no single-stacker, or I&rsquo;m a landsman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&mdash;she isn&rsquo;t! I can see&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;<i>four</i>
funnels! Jingoes! She
must be a whopper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; muttered Bill, half to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? But I can see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not doubting your word, Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you wondering about then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember the <i>Amtonia</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Amtonia?</i> Why, she&rsquo;s the big British liner
that was held up at sea a couple of months ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A freighter SOS&rsquo;d and when the
<i>Amtonia</i> went to offer help, the crew of the
tramp forced the liner&rsquo;s crew and passengers to
swap steamers. Then they made off with the
big ship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I remember all about that. Harry
Davis&rsquo; dad was on the <i>Amtonia</i>, coming home
from England, when it happened. It was in
the papers but I got the inside dope from Harry.
His old man told him all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dollars to a dead stick, you&rsquo;ll be able to tell
Harry Davis more about the <i>Amtonia</i> than he
ever dreamed of, one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;that ship over there is the
<i>Amtonia</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. See&mdash;she&rsquo;s hove to now&mdash;and the
<i>Flying Fish</i> is nosing over for a landing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two in the speeding amphibian saw the
<i>Flying Fish</i> descend in a long glide to the surface
of the ocean and taxi toward the great
steamer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the <i>Amtonia</i>, all right, all right!&rdquo;
said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, she&rsquo;s big. What&rsquo;s her tonnage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five thousand tons, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&mdash;Say, listen, do you suppose
Mother and Dad are on board her now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if your Mother
and Father and some other boys&rsquo; papas and
mammas, along with them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is, unless business in the ransom line is
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;considering the number
of passengers watching us and the <i>Flying Fish</i>
from her decks&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t. Shut up now, kid,&rdquo;
he added, cutting his gun and pushing forward
the stick. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going down and it sure
would look rotten to nose into the drink with
that gallery&rsquo;s eyes on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! And what about us in that case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boston papers,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;please copy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down they soared, straight into the wind to
land with hardly a splash, went skimming over
the water for fifty or sixty yards and came to
rest just behind the <i>Flying Fish</i>. Charlie, at
Bill&rsquo;s bidding, flung out the sea anchor.</p>
<p>To port lay the <i>Amtonia</i>, now Baron von
Hiemskirk&rsquo;s traffic raider, and neither lad was
surprised to see that she was blatantly flying the
flag of piracy, a skull and crossed bones of white
on a black field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Bill had no difficulty in recognizing the
<i>Amtonia</i>. She was one of the largest passenger
ships afloat, and consequently hard to disguise.
Her camouflaged hull and stacks, painted in
broad wavy stripes of grey-green and black
made it still harder to judge her length on the
waterline. He knew, however, that she must
be quite as long as two city blocks, and her many
decks rose above the amphibian to the height of
a ten-story building. Her four gigantic funnels&mdash;so
huge that the greatest locomotive could
have passed through one of them lengthwise
without scraping&mdash;and her tall masts, made her
easily recognizable to the young midshipman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; exclaimed Charlie, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a gob
on the <i>Flying Fish</i> signalling the liner. Gee,
I wish I understood wigwag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you did,&rdquo; said Bill, standing up on the
pilot&rsquo;s seat and flapping his arms like a semaphore,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;d know he was signalling us and
not the <i>Amtonia</i>. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, kid,
button that lip of yours. I want to get this
message.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Bill then snatched up the helmet he had just
doffed and clapped it on again, buckling the
flaps over his ears. Charlie watched proceedings
with interest that for once was wordless.
Presently the sailor aboard the <i>Flying Fish</i>
stopped waving his two red flags. Bill answered
him with his arms, and the man rolled up his
flags and went below.</p>
<p>Bill Bolton unbuckled the chin-strap of his
helmet and turned toward the rear cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snap on that safety belt and put on your
helmet again,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t take it
off this time until I tell you to. We are going
aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aboard what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Amtonia</i>, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can I go aboard that liner if I&rsquo;m
tied to this seat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see&mdash;I&rsquo;m too busy to talk now&mdash;even
if you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill got down, started the engine idling and
commenced to haul in their sea anchor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Charlie stood up in the rear cockpit and
called to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Bill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>are</i> we going aboard if I&rsquo;m to be tied
up in this belt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great jumping snakes!&rdquo; exploded Bill,
with a furious glance over his shoulder. &ldquo;Have
you still got that safety-belt on the brain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;around the middle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a counterfeit two-cent piece with a hole
in it, I&rsquo;d throw you into the Atlantic and let
you swim aboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, please tell me, Bill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you must know each detail, we&rsquo;re
going aboard by way of the electric crane&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, quit yer kidding&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t any
electric trains out here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not train, bozo&mdash;<i>c-r-a-n-e</i>&mdash;hoist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! an electric crane! Are they going to
hoist us up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Bill, as he stowed away their
mooring, &ldquo;is the usual procedure when cranes
are used. Sometimes up&mdash;sometimes down&mdash;and&mdash;chew
on this one thoughtfully, for this
is the point of the story: Sometimes when the
tackle slips on a haul, there is a tendency to
slip sideways. And then, little chatterbox,
since it is this amphibian which is to be hauled
upward, and you who will be sitting in said
amphibian&mdash;the aforementioned safety belt is
likely to prove mighty useful. <i>Now</i> do you
savez?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup. But my teacher usta tell me that a
straight line is the shortest distance between two
points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when,&rdquo; replied Bill with a grin, &ldquo;you
want to make a home run, it is absolutely
necessary to touch all three bases and the plate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah? Well, I think it&rsquo;s pretty tough
when a feller can&rsquo;t open his mouth without bein&rsquo;
told to pipe down every other minute!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Charles. It&rsquo;s a long worm&mdash;you
know. And you&rsquo;ve got this one on his back
with your chatter. The Baron said that this
was war, and I, for one, believe he&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; Charlie chortled, &ldquo;Sherman said that
war was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that <i>and</i> more. Nothing slow about you
when it comes to pickup. Well, there&rsquo;s the
crane showing topside. Reckon I&rsquo;d better feed
the old girl a little more gas and mosey over
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter VII</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ABOARD</span></h2>
<p>The <i>Amtonia</i> had stopped her engines and
now lay broadside on to the gentle groundswell.
Bill landed to leeward of the great ship, and
taxied the amphibian upwind to a point off her
leeward quarter. Then he shut off his motor
and when the plane&rsquo;s momentum carried her
to within a few yards of the hull, towering
high above the little aircraft, he ordered
Charlie to fling out the sea anchor. Their
drift, of course, was to leeward, so the
manoeuver brought them nose on to the ship&rsquo;s
side, directly below the long arm of the hoist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>In order that seaplanes may be taken aboard
ships, flying boats are provided with slings.
Bill&rsquo;s craft being an amphibian, was equipped
with retractible landing gear, operated electrically
from the cockpits. But inasmuch as
the <i>Amtonia</i> boasted no deck upon which an
airplane might land, the hoist was the only
means available.</p>
<p>A heaving line was cast to the amphibian as
soon as her propeller stopped, and made secure
while Bill and Charlie worked like beavers
to secure the wing lines. That accomplished,
the lads broke out the sling, and after considerable
trouble, passed it completely around the
hull of their craft, using spreaders to prevent
crushing during the hoist aboard.</p>
<p>While they were working on these details,
the hoisting hook was let down to them and
presently the sling was made fast to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! Look at the gallery now!&rdquo;
cried Charlie, staring up at the line of faces
along the deck rails of the steamer. &ldquo;Say!
there&rsquo;s Dad&mdash;and Mother! And there&rsquo;s Uncle
Arthur! See them up there, next to the top
deck! They&rsquo;re waving to us! Hi, Dad!
Hello, Mother! Hello, Uncle Arthur!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Swell,&rdquo; was Bill&rsquo;s preoccupied comment.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve found your people, kid. But
get into the rear cockpit now, and pipe down a
bit, please. This is a ticklish job and unless you
keep quiet so I can do a bit of talking to those
guys on the ship, it&rsquo;s likely to turn into a first
class accident instead of a reunion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie, only slightly abashed, subsided in
his seat, but he kept on waving frantically to
his parents.</p>
<p>Then a chief petty officer, who stood by the
rail just below the arm of the hoist, raised a
megaphone to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avast below!&rdquo; he roared, showing a strong
foreign accent. &ldquo;Is that sling secure, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All secure!&rdquo; called back Bill. &ldquo;But be sure
your men keep the slack out of our wing lines
when you hoist us. I don&rsquo;t want the plane to
start swinging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir. Are you quite ready, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand by to be hoisted, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The officer raised a hand. There came a
creaking of the sling as the hoist hook caught
up the slack, then very slowly the plane rose
out of the water on her upward journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and keep perfectly quiet, Charlie,&rdquo;
ordered Bill. &ldquo;If we start the plane see-sawing,
there&rsquo;ll be the dickens and all to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie did as he was told. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry
about me, skipper,&rdquo; he answered in a somewhat
aggrieved tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not me that&rsquo;s raising all
the row now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passengers, or possibly they might better
be termed prisoners on board the liner, were
waving handkerchiefs and calling greetings to
the boys. Any break in the monotony of ship
life is always made the most of, and Bill surmised
that many of these people had been held
on board the liner for weeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>The plane in its sling went slowly upward,
watched by the enthusiastic gallery on the
promenade deck. The hoist was situated far
forward and as the amphibian topped the bulwarks,
it was swung aboard and deposited on
deck beside an open hatch. No more had she
been landed and braced than Charlie jumped
out and raced off to seek his parents.</p>
<p>Bill, in the meantime, had his hands full. It
was explained to him that inasmuch as the
<i>Amtonia</i> was not equipped for the carrying of
aircraft, the plane must be dissembled in order
to permit its being stowed away in the hold. A
number of men were told off to assist him and
for the next couple of hours, he was busily engaged
directing the work. Wing sections were
removed first and lowered through the hatchway.
The tail plane came next, and at the
same time, the propeller was taken from the
engine. Last of all, lines were riven about the
hull and made fast to heavy fittings on the
plane, such as engine bearers. Then the denuded
hull was hoisted from the deck and
lowered nose first into the hold. Even then
Bill&rsquo;s work was not completed, for it was necessary,
of course, to secure everything below
against possible damage from the rolling or
pitching of the ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Sandwiches and coffee were served to him
by a steward, while he was still on deck. He
had sent his excuses when the captain had
asked him to lunch, as he felt it imperative
that he stay with the men on the job.</p>
<p>It was three-thirty before the work was
finished to his satisfaction, and with a petty
officer as guide, he located the Baron in his
cabin. The <i>Amtonia</i> had got under way again
several hours earlier. Upon coming topside, he
saw that the ship was steaming into the north-east.
Close in their wake, the <i>Flying Fish</i>,
once more a submarine, ploughed the smooth
surface of the ocean.</p>
<p>When Bill entered the captain&rsquo;s cabin, he
found the Baron seated at his desk, reading a
paper which had just been handed him by the
wireless operator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stand by for a few minutes, Mr. Bolton,&rdquo;
he said, putting the note aside. &ldquo;Take a seat
on the couch. I have need of you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill sat down while Baron von Hiemskirk
went on talking to the operator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your best to find out what other craft are
in the vicinity and report to me on the bridge as
soon as possible.&rdquo; He said this in German
which Bill understood but did not speak well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; returned the man, saluted
and departed.</p>
<p>The Baron stood up, picked up his cap and
turned to Bill who also rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All secure with the plane below?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All secure, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Come along then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they passed through the thwartship
passage and out on deck. They reached
the top deck of the superstructure by a steep
stair and went forward. From this deck another
stair led to the bridge, where a sailor with
rifle and sidearms stood sentry. The man
brought his gun to &ldquo;present&rdquo; and both the
Baron and Bill punctiliously returned the salute.
Long before this Bill had come to realize that
strict naval discipline was enforced to the letter
aboard this pirate ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Once they were on the bridge an officer came
forward and saluted.</p>
<p>The Baron said stiffly: &ldquo;Commander Geibel&mdash;Mr.
Bolton&mdash;in charge of flight operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commander and Bill shook hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the lookout reported anything during
the past quarter of an hour?&rdquo; inquired the
Baron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Commander Geibel and the others instinctively
glanced toward the foremast where about
halfway to the top was located the ship&rsquo;s first
lookout station. This station, Bill was to learn,
always held an officer and his assistant. Still
higher up the mast in the crow&rsquo;s nest, a sharp-eyed
seaman, especially trained to this service,
kept a vigilant scrutiny on the horizon. When
the man in the crow&rsquo;s nest discerned smoke or
haze which seemed to indicate a ship, he called
to the men in the lookout below. Instantly all
glasses would be trained in the direction he gave
them, and the bridge would make ready to act
upon the result of their discovery.</p>
<p>The Baron turned to Commander Geibel
again. &ldquo;We have just received a wireless that
the French liner <i>Orleans</i> is about sixty miles to
the northward, steaming east. She carries the
mails, you know, and a capacity load of first
class passengers. I think she will be worth detaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly so, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make ready to stop the ship, if you please.
Also signal the <i>Flying Fish</i> to prepare for a
flight. While I am away, you will be in
supreme command, as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Herr Baron. Any further
orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You will maintain the usual routine.
Good afternoon, Herr Commander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I wish the Herr Baron his usual success
and a pleasant trip?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Herr Geibel.&rdquo; The two shook
hands. &ldquo;<i>Auf wiedersehn!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Auf wiedersehn</i>, Herr Baron! <i>Auf wiedersehn</i>,
Herr Bolton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Auf wiedersehn</i>, Commander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They saluted. Commander Geibel stepped
to the engine room telegraph and the Baron
with Bill at his heels left the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to my cabin. I want to say a few
words to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill knew that Commander Geibel had
given the order &ldquo;All engines ahead one-third.&rdquo;
So he was not surprised by the time they
entered the Captain&rsquo;s cabin to find that the
vibration from the ship&rsquo;s propellers had
ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand, Mr. Bolton,&rdquo; the Baron
said, &ldquo;that we are about to capture a trans-Atlantic
liner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that such is your purpose, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are ready to obey orders&mdash;to pilot the
<i>Flying Fish</i> as we agreed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Bill was silent for a moment. &ldquo;And if I
refuse?&rdquo; he asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it will be my painful duty to place
both you and Chief Osceola in the brig and
keep you there until we make port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Osceola now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is still aboard the <i>Flying Fish</i>. He is to
act as your assistant. You see, my dear fellow,&rdquo;
the Baron went on, his manner changing from
curtness to affability. &ldquo;As a midshipman in the
United States Navy, you are too dangerous a
person to allow you to mix freely with the
other passengers of this ship, unless&mdash;shall I
put it frankly?&mdash;unless I have a hold of some
kind over you. Those people, wealthy men and
women, or they should not be here, are nevertheless
but a flock of sheep. You and the Chief
proved in Florida that you were made of different
stuff. Aboard the <i>Merrymaid</i>, I gave
you my reasons for the offer. What is your
final answer, now that you have had time to
think it over?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Bill hesitated no longer. &ldquo;I will fly the
plane as agreed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But there, my duty
to you and your organization ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That satisfies me. I am glad to take your
word as an officer and a gentleman on this
matter.&rdquo; He rose from his chair and beamed
at Bill. &ldquo;My organization is perfect, Mr.
Bolton&mdash;perfect. You will have no chance to
escape&mdash;there is no where to escape to&mdash;but if
you and your friend should wish to try&mdash;you
have my permission to do so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill smiled, and said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to shove off now,&rdquo; continued the
Baron bruskly. &ldquo;The boat will be waiting for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>They went overside by means of a ship&rsquo;s
ladder and were rowed over to the <i>Flying Fish</i>.
Her airplane engines were making their appearance
topside by the time they stepped
aboard. For a few minutes Bill watched them
rise one by one, and slide on grooved tracks into
place. At the same time, he noticed that the
decking just forward of the central motor was
moving upward to reveal itself as the roof of a
glass-sided structure about two feet high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s under that?&rdquo; he asked the Baron,
&ldquo;the pilot&rsquo;s cockpit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so. Come below and we&rsquo;ll inspect it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter VIII</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">PIRACY</span></h2>
<p>While they had been talking, Bill saw the
conning tower lower itself until it stood not
more than a foot above the deck aft of the huge
wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This certainly is the most remarkable ship
I&rsquo;ve ever seen, or ever hope to see,&rdquo; he exclaimed
as they descended into the hull through
the conning tower hatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I designed most of these gadgets before the
close of the last war,&rdquo; replied the Baron in his
usual pompous manner. &ldquo;The armistice interrupted
my experiments and as there was no
government that amounted to anything in my
country then, I kept the results of my work for
myself. Some little time ago, speculation in
your American stocks gave me sufficient capital
to build that ship with added improvements.
Now I am cashing in on her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>The Diesel engines were drawing air from
an intake valve just under the small bridge as
they dropped into the control room where Bill
and the Baron studied the charts for a while, and
he was given the course he was to fly. They
passed through the battery room where the walls
were lined with the crews&rsquo; bunks and into the
pilot&rsquo;s glassed-in cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Osceola beamed at them from one
of the pilot&rsquo;s seats. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure good to see you
again, Bill, old boy. How do you do, Baron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron was annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is customary aboard my ships for a
superior officer to receive a salute when spoken
to. And the salute should be rendered standing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola smiled, stood up, clicked his heels
together and brought the fingers of his right
hand smartly to the edge of the soft helmet he
wore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; The Baron punctiliously returned
the salute. &ldquo;Good afternoon, Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned his back on the young
Seminole and spoke again to Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the buzzer rings in here, Mr. Bolton,
you will start idling your engines and take off
as soon as possible immediately afterward. You
know your course and you have instructions
with regard to landing. Further orders will be
sent to you should I consider them necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, sir,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>Both young fellows saluted. The Baron returned
their salutes and left the cockpit, sliding
the door to behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; exploded Osceola. &ldquo;That lad gives
me the jim-jams with his confounded bowing
and saluting. I&rsquo;ll turn into a Prussian Yunker
myself if we don&rsquo;t get out of this soon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon you weren&rsquo;t cut out for a Naval
man,&rdquo; laughed Bill, &ldquo;I admit I&rsquo;ve had my fill
of that stuff at the Academy, but the Herr Baron
certainly goes the whole hog. Let&rsquo;s see what
kind of a crate I&rsquo;ve got to run,&rdquo; he mused&mdash;&ldquo;ten
motors&mdash;dual control&mdash;aeromarine inertia
starter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He studied the layout thoughtfully and
glanced at the instrument board. Then he
turned to Osceola again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven, they&rsquo;ve fitted this bus with
the wheel and column type of control. The
clever bird has stolen some of the Fokker
features. That worm gear, operated by a crank
and shaft from the pilot&rsquo;s seat to adjust the
stabilizer in flight proves it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; grinned his friend. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all
Greek to me. The joke of it is that these bozos
think I understand&mdash;that I&rsquo;m an aviator like
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve given you some pointers, haven&rsquo;t
I? You ought to recognize a few of these
gadgets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief snorted. &ldquo;<i>Few</i> is right. Your
amphibian is one thing&mdash;but this bus is fitted
out like the engine room of an ocean liner!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Bill laughed and picked up a soft helmet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever been in one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An engine room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet&mdash;and I hope never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so. Well, Mr. Assistant Pilot,
get into your seat and look pretty. I&rsquo;ll do the
work. Confound, there goes the buzzer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slipped into his seat and his hand sought
the inertia starter. With her multiple engines
roaring in deafening crescendo, the <i>Flying Fish</i>
leapt through the water and was jerked onto
her step, quite as easily as the smallest seaplane.
A few seconds later she was in the air, nosing
upward into the ether.</p>
<p>Bill ran her up to thirty-five hundred feet,
leveled off, did a sharp bank to port, then
straightened out once more and spoke to Osceola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some bus! Runs like a ladies&rsquo; wristwatch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you keeping pretty low?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sense climbing higher. The
skipper wants to get there in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;you know this is rank piracy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Osceola. But it&rsquo;s a long chance&mdash;and
a darned sight better for our plans than being
cooped up in the brig. If I wasn&rsquo;t driving this
plane, the Baron would be. Friend von Hiemskirk
is so sure of himself he says that we have
his permission to escape&mdash;if we can. I&rsquo;d like
to give him a run, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, nice of him, isn&rsquo;t it? Still, we got
away from the Shell Island gang, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure did&mdash;and put those guys in a place
where they belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m entirely willing to try it with this
bunch&mdash;but between you and me, I&rsquo;m almost
inclined to agree with the Baron&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
think we&rsquo;ve the ghost of a show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not. But we&rsquo;ll make a good stab at
it, just the same. First of all, we&rsquo;ve got to know
how they work their game. That&rsquo;s the principal
reason why I took over this job. It&rsquo;s not only
escape I&rsquo;m after, but it&rsquo;s busting up this organized
piracy, as well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ambitious, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;hello! there&rsquo;s smoke on the horizon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I see it. Dead ahead. Think she&rsquo;s
the ship we want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope so. We&rsquo;re following the course.
Herr Pomposo plotted it himself, so he can&rsquo;t
strafe us if it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola clapped a pair of glasses to his eyes
and studied the distant smudge of black that
was curling up a blue horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three funnels. Looks like a pretty big
ship&mdash;and she sure is moving along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Orleans</i> is a three-stacker. Also, she&rsquo;s
plenty big and fast. Push that button on the
instrument board marked &lsquo;C.R.&rsquo;, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola complied. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s C.R. mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Control room. I want to let his high-mightiness
know we&rsquo;ve sighted his prey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Osceola, &ldquo;begins to get exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;get a good deal more
exciting than we bargained for unless you pipe
down, old man. There&rsquo;s some ticklish business
ahead of us and I can&rsquo;t afford to crack it.
Now&mdash;get these instructions, and get &rsquo;em right.
That handle yonder works the bomb release.
When I say the word, take hold of it&mdash;but don&rsquo;t
pull until I tell you to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;Bill!&rdquo; protested the Seminole. &ldquo;You
surely aren&rsquo;t taking orders from von Hiemskirk
or anyone else to bomb that liner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I know it,&rdquo; Bill answered curtly.
&ldquo;Get your mind on the job. When I say NOW&mdash;you
pull. Not one instant sooner, or an
instant later. It&rsquo;s a matter of life and death&mdash;so
be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; said his mystified friend, lifting
a nervous gaze to stare at the great steamer
they were approaching so swiftly.</p>
<p>The <i>Orleans</i> was a beautiful sight; a racing
greyhound of the seas, tearing through a glassy
ocean, bound for Europe with mail and passengers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The <i>Flying Fish</i> came upon her from the
south. As he drew nearer the leviathan, Bill
decreased the plane&rsquo;s altitude to a meager five
hundred feet. Below the belching funnels he
could see passengers and crew crowding the
starboard rails, for even the most <i>blas&eacute;</i> traveler
is still thrilled by the sight of an airplane in
mid-ocean.</p>
<p>The great plane circled the ship. Then Bill
dropped behind for a moment, did a flipper
turn to port, levelled off and came racing up
from the rear. When the <i>Flying Fish</i> was
directly over the steamer&rsquo;s stern, Bill spoke to
Osceola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! You can&rsquo;t do it, Bill. It&rsquo;s
murder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up&mdash;and obey orders!&rdquo; commanded
his pilot. &ldquo;This is my funeral&mdash;not yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola grasped the bomb release, his brain
whirling in consternation and confusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Slowly they forged ahead, over the stacks,
the foremast, the bow, and on until they had
gained a lead of possibly two hundred yards on
the <i>Orleans</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NOW!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back came Osceola&rsquo;s hand, yanking the
handle and at the same time Bill banked the
plane in a sharp left turn. Osceola descried an
object darting seaward beneath them. He
glimpsed it strike the water and a geyser shot
upward in front of the racing liner. Then as
the <i>Flying Fish</i> came about and landed, he saw
that the <i>Orleans</i> was slowing down. By the
time their own craft was moored to a sea anchor,
the liner&rsquo;s propellers no longer turned and she
lay like a &ldquo;painted ship upon a painted ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both lads stripped off their headgear as the
Baron walked into the cockpit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am about to board the <i>Orleans</i>,&rdquo; he stated
in that overbearing tone that was so irritating to
Osceola. &ldquo;You young gentlemen will accompany
me. We leave directly. Once aboard, it
will be your duty to make note of the quantity
of gasoline and lubricating oils carried by the
liner and render a report to me. I shall probably
be found in the First Class dining salon,
where passengers will be interviewed. Come
now, it is time we were off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bill and Osceola came out on deck
they saw that a three-inch gun had been brought
topside and was trained on the <i>Orleans</i>. Signals
had evidently passed between the <i>Flying Fish</i>
and the liner, which lay motionless a few
hundred yards off their port quarter. Even as
the boarding party, armed to the teeth, stepped
into a small launch, a gangway was let down
from the side of the leviathan.</p>
<p>The journey across took but a very few
minutes. Bill had only time to note that the
<i>Orleans</i> no longer flew her colors and that the
decks were still crowded with passengers, when
the seaman in the bow of their launch caught
the grating at the bottom of the steep flight of
steps with his boathook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>The Baron immediately sprang onto the
grating and, followed by another officer, Bill,
Osceola and four seamen bearing rifles, mounted
the gangway. The launch in the meantime
hastened back toward the <i>Flying Fish</i> to pick up
another load of men.</p>
<p>An indignant officer, whose uniform proclaimed
him to be the ship&rsquo;s captain, met them
as they stepped on deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an outrage!&rdquo; he thundered, addressing
the Baron. &ldquo;By what right do you threaten
my ship and board her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Von Hiemskirk smiled cynically at the
scowling captain, and bowed, including the row
of ship&rsquo;s officers and men who stood close behind
him, in his salutation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make a mistake, Captain,&rdquo; he replied
affably, &ldquo;when you say &lsquo;my ship.&rsquo; Allow me to
inform you that she is no longer yours&mdash;but
mine&mdash;by right of conquest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is&mdash;piracy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said the Baron, &ldquo;that you realize
the fact.&rdquo; He changed his tone abruptly.
&ldquo;Permit me to inform you also that unless my
orders are obeyed&mdash;obeyed on the instant,&mdash;it
will be my unpleasant duty to sink this ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man in the uniform of the ship&rsquo;s wireless
operator pushed his way through the crowd of
protesting passengers and saluting the <i>Orleans</i>
captain, whispered a few words in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No secrets,&rdquo; snapped the Baron. &ldquo;Operator,
what message have you brought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now the captain&rsquo;s turn to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will answer your question,&rdquo; he returned.
&ldquo;We have been in touch with the United States
Cruiser <i>Stamford</i>. At the present moment, she
is steaming at full speed to this spot!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter IX</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE BARON&rsquo;S METHODS</span></h2>
<p>Baron von Hiemskirk roared with laughter.
&ldquo;Splendid, Captain&mdash;splendid! To use an
American expression, Herr Captain&mdash;we pirates
are not always as dumb as we may look. I
know all about that warship. It will take her
five hours, fast steaming, to reach this ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his back contemptuously on the
furious skipper and walked to the rail. A
glance overside told him that the launch,
crowded to the gunwales with more men from
the <i>Flying Fish</i> was nosing the landing stage
below. He again approached the choleric
officer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;I now take over this ship. Order your crew
to the forecastle and your officers to their cabins.
You and I, my friend, will repair to your
quarters. I want to look over your ship&rsquo;s
papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the second boarding party
reached the deck, and commands snapped from
the Baron like reports from a machine gun.</p>
<p>Accompanied by an armed seaman from the
<i>Flying Fish</i>, Bill and Osceola followed the
chief commissary steward below. The man
had been told off for the duty by the Baron,
with a promise that if there were any complaints
upon their return, he would be shot. On second
thought, he had expanded Bill&rsquo;s orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will attend to the oil and gas,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and in addition, you will commandeer all
stores leaving two days&rsquo; crews&rsquo; rations for the
passengers. Break out what men you need and
get the supplies to this deck on the port side.
And just as quickly as possible, Mr. Bolton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrived at the chief steward&rsquo;s office, he was
amazed to learn from the man&rsquo;s lists the vast
amount of eatables carried by the liner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, there&rsquo;s everything here from caviar
to oatmeal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, orders are orders,&rdquo; said Osceola.
&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re deciding what to take and what
to leave, I&rsquo;ll get hold of the crew and meet you
below in the storerooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-o! I&rsquo;ll be with you in a jiffy. I
hate to have to do this, but if we don&rsquo;t make a
clean job of it, you and I will finish out this
cruise in the well-known brig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next few hours, both lads worked like
beavers superintending the transportation of
supplies. Leaving Osceola in charge below, Bill
went up to the deck where the boxes, barrels and
crates from the storerooms were being stacked
by members of the captured liner&rsquo;s crew. The
<i>Flying Fish</i>, now transformed into her guise of
submarine, came along side, a hoist was brought
into use and the provisions lowered to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>It soon became evident that the underseas
boat&rsquo;s cargo capacity would take but a fraction
of the plunder, so Bill ordered the <i>Orleans&rsquo;</i> lifeboats
to be lowered. One by one, these were
loaded. The first boat to receive its quota of
goods was secured to the <i>Flying Fish</i> by a tow-line,
and the bow of each succeeding lifeboat
made fast by a line to the stern of the one ahead.
When the last load of crates was being lowered
overside, Bill found Osceola at his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That tears it, I reckon. Good plan that&mdash;using
the boats. I wondered how you were
going to load all that stuff in the <i>Flying
Fish</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hated to do it,&rdquo; admitted his friend, &ldquo;but
now that the <i>Orleans</i> is practically without provisions,
she will have to return to New York,
and she can make port in less than twenty-four
hours. With this fine weather, there&rsquo;s little or
no danger of the passengers needing the boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do now?&rdquo; asked Osceola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Report to Herr Baron, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill hailed one of the submarine&rsquo;s petty
officers who was herding the crew back to their
quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where we&rsquo;ll find Baron von
Hiemskirk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is in the main dining salon, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Osceola,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;He
must be pretty nearly finished with his own
particular job. I hope so, anyway. If that
cruiser shows up and we&rsquo;re caught&mdash;well, it
will take a lot of explaining to justify our part
in this. The chances are, I&rsquo;d be handed my discharge
from the Navy, if nothing worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola nodded gloomily and the two made
their way along an almost empty deck to the
main companionway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where the passengers have disappeared
to,&rdquo; mused the young Seminole, as they
descended the broad staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve probably been sent to their cabins
for the time being. If my guess is a good one,
the big boy is at present engaged in robbing the
entire first class of their valuables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly a bad bit of work, Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I know it. But some day we may be
able to get even with this polite pirate. Just
now all we can do is to smile and take orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the Baron seated at the head of
the captain&rsquo;s table. An angry gentleman, his
wife and two pretty daughters, under guard of
a seaman, stood before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rodney Conway and family, of New
York.&rdquo; The Baron glanced at a list he held.
&ldquo;I am glad to say that this little interview will
conclude my business aboard the <i>Orleans</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; cut in the passenger. &ldquo;This
whole thing is preposterous! Why, your men
have ransacked our cabins and stolen nearly
everything of value we have with us. If, as
you seem to be, you are German citizens, I shall
certainly make a complaint in person to the
German ambassador, when this ship lands us in
England!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>The Baron von Hiemskirk smiled, but the
smile was not a pleasant one. &ldquo;I do not recognize
the present German government,&rdquo; he said
sneeringly, &ldquo;and it also may interest you to
know that they are quite as keen to apprehend
me and put a stop to my business ventures as
you are. Furthermore, Mr. Conway, you and
your family are not going to England&mdash;not by
this ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Conway started visibly. Then he drew
himself up: &ldquo;I do not care for myself&mdash;but I
must beg of you to spare my wife and
daughters&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron put up a restraining hand.
&ldquo;There is no cause for alarm, Mr. Conway.
Unless, of course, you prove to be unreasonable.
Who&rsquo;s Who tells me that you are president of
the Western Hemisphere Bank in New York
City, and that you are on the board of directors
of other important financial institutions. Now,
there will be a small matter of ransom to go
into before we part company. At present, time
presses. You and your family will go for a
cruise with me&mdash;an agreeable one, I trust&mdash;until
this business of ransom can be attended to.
You will go on deck with this seaman now.
Your cabin baggage has already left the ship.
That will be all, I think.&rdquo; He stood up in dismissal,
and bowed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; he beamed, &ldquo;and bon
voyage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Conway family, under guard, left the
salon. Baron von Hiemskirk beckoned to Bill
and Osceola who had been silent witnesses of this
charming scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to report, sir,&rdquo; said Bill at once, &ldquo;that
the supplies have been placed aboard the <i>Flying
Fish</i> and the lifeboats. They are now ready for
transport to the <i>Amtonia</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Bolton, and you, too, Chief.
I was certain that I could trust you with the job.
That was a good idea to use the lifeboats. If a
heavy sea had been running the greater part of
the stuff must have been left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; said Osceola, &ldquo;that you
would have brought up the <i>Amtonia</i> and placed
the stuff aboard her direct.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>The Baron smiled goodhumoredly. &ldquo;Mr.
Bolton can you tell him my reason for not doing
so? I am not really a blood-thirsty person by
nature, Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baron von Hiemskirk does not wish vessels
like the <i>Orleans</i> to know that the <i>Amtonia</i> is
in his service, Osceola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has bloodthirstiness got to do with
it, if I may ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill answered this too. &ldquo;I suppose the Baron
feels it would be necessary to sink such vessels
whose crews or passengers guess his secret. Am
I right, Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite, Mr. Bolton. That warship, for instance,
will arrive here in an hour or so. All
that she can learn from those left aboard this
ship is that the <i>Flying Fish</i> and the <i>Orleans</i>
boats have departed in such and such a direction&mdash;which,
of course, will not be the one they will
eventually take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t they wireless that news to the
<i>Stamford</i> just as soon as we leave the ship?&rdquo; inquired
the Chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; replied the Baron gently, &ldquo;will
use the wireless after we leave, for the simple
reason that this ship&rsquo;s wireless will not be in
working order. Now we will go on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way up the staircase without
speaking further. At the entrance to the companionway,
they were met by one of the Baron&rsquo;s
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg to report, sir, that all decks have been
cleared. Passengers and crew are locked in their
cabins. The fires have been drawn and the wireless
has been put out of commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. We shall shove off at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer preceded them toward the gangway
where a squad of armed seamen were drawn
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; cried Osceola. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s become
of the <i>Flying Fish</i>? She&rsquo;s disappeared. Surely
she can&rsquo;t have submerged and carried the boats
down with her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck,&rdquo; muttered Bill sotto voce.
&ldquo;There she is, with her blooming boats in tow,
off to the westward. She probably got underway
about the time we went below. What&rsquo;s the
matter, Osceola? You seem to be in the dumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hate this work we&rsquo;ve been doing,
that&rsquo;s all, Bill. Unless we can act pretty soon&mdash;do
something to stop this robbing of innocent
people, I&rsquo;ll be so low, I&rsquo;ll have to reach up to
touch bottom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, I&rsquo;m with you. I could hardly keep
quiet when that interview with the Conways
took place. But tonight, we&rsquo;ll talk. Keep
smiling now&mdash;here we are at the gangway. Gee,
we&rsquo;re swiping the <i>Orleans</i> launch! I wondered
how we were going to get back to the <i>Amtonia</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These guys,&rdquo; said Osceola disgustedly,
&ldquo;snatch everything that&rsquo;s loose. What&rsquo;s nailed
down they pull up and charge the owners for the
nails!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following the Baron, who was conversing
with an officer, they went down the steps of
the gangway, and took seats in the waiting
launch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter X</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BILL STARTS IN</span></h2>
<p>The launch, a highpowered craft, soon
caught up with the submarine and its string of
loaded lifeboats. Darkness had fallen before
the little flotilla reached the mothership, but the
plunder was quickly taken aboard, and the lifeboats
were sunk. Within an hour of their arrival,
the <i>Amtonia</i> with her submarine pilot-fish
were heading into the northeast again.</p>
<p>The two lads were given a large, comfortable
cabin together, where they found the baggage
from their amphibian had been stowed. They
had just taken a shower in the luxuriously appointed
bathroom off their cabin, when there
came a knock at the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Captain&rsquo;s compliments, sir,&rdquo; said the
steward when Bill opened to him, &ldquo;and will you
gentlemen dine with him and his officers at eight
thirty in the Palm Garden? He asks me to
inform you, sir, that you will find uniforms in
your closet. He begs that you will not wear
civilian clothes while aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Baron von Hiemskirk on behalf of
Chief Osceola and myself. We shall be glad
to join the officers&rsquo; mess at half past eight. We
shall also put on the uniforms he has provided,
although I must say that nothing looks worse
than a uniform one hasn&rsquo;t been fitted for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, sir, but the tailor has already
altered the uniforms. He took measurements
from the suits in your bags. He and his men
are working on more of them tonight. He tells
me that they will all be finished soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;That will be fine.
By the way, where is the Palm Garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off A deck, sir. Thank you, sir.&rdquo; He was
gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; grinned Bill, &ldquo;some system they
have aboard this packet!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;You said it. Too much system to suit me,
Bill. We&rsquo;re likely to come a bad cropper when
we buck it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the adage about crossing bridges
before you have to, Osceola. Let&rsquo;s get into
these uniforms. It&rsquo;s nearly time for mess and
I&rsquo;m hungry enough to chew rubber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The uniforms proved to be made of white
duck, and the lads found their names stitched
inside the blouses. An officer&rsquo;s cap and pair
of white canvas shoes went with each suit. To
their further surprise, they found that all these
articles fitted them exactly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; exclaimed Bill, as he saw the two gold
stripes on his black shoulder straps. &ldquo;This is
promotion with a vengeance! When I woke
up this morning, I was only a midshipman. Tonight
I&rsquo;m a full lieutenant! What&rsquo;s the Baron
made you, big boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a broad stripe like yours, Bill, and
a narrow one. I suppose that rates me something&mdash;but
what, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the insignia of a lieutenant j.g.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s the j.g. mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Junior grade. A j.g. ranks with a first lieutenant
in the army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, with your two broad stripes rank
with an army captain, I suppose, and you&rsquo;re my
superior officer on board here, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Only we say full stripes, not broad
stripes. In Navy parlance, I&rsquo;m a two-striper,
and you are a one-and-a-half striper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds to me like a convict gang,&rdquo; laughed
the Seminole, as he buttoned up his blouse.
&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re ready, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget your cap,&rdquo; Bill reminded him.
&ldquo;Strictly speaking, no naval officer is in uniform
without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pirate officer, you mean,&rdquo; grunted Osceola
as they entered the corridor. &ldquo;Last time we
were kidnapped and lacked all this luxury, but
at least what clothes we wore were comfortable.
I feel as if somebody had laced me
into a tight corset.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel better after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. If the buttons hold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they mounted the stairs to A deck.
A few of the <i>Amtonia&rsquo;s</i> passengers were lounging
about on deck. They paid not the slightest
attention to them, in fact, Bill noticed that their
indifference was so marked that it could not be
other than studied.</p>
<p>Then a voice spoke behind them. &ldquo;Hello,
men!&rdquo; As they turned, Charlie joined them.
&ldquo;I wanted Father to meet you,&rdquo; he said, rather
breathlessly, &ldquo;but he says you&rsquo;ve joined the
pirates, and&mdash; But you haven&rsquo;t, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola looked down at him quizzically.
&ldquo;Only pro tem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, what does that mean? I wish you&rsquo;d
talk American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I spoke my own language, which is real
American, youngster, you wouldn&rsquo;t understand
me any better.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Bill grinned. &ldquo;Pro tem means for the time
being,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d better tell you,
Charlie, that the Chief is feeling low tonight,
so don&rsquo;t get fresh. He&rsquo;ll tomahawk you one of
these days if you don&rsquo;t look out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah?&rdquo; Charlie seemed unimpressed
by this dire threat. Then his tone changed suddenly.
&ldquo;Please, Bill,&rdquo; he whispered eagerly,
&ldquo;let me be a pirate, too. Gee, it would be such
fun. Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Bill and Osceola burst into a shout of
laughter. &ldquo;But how about your Dad?&rdquo; asked
the Seminole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill shook his head. &ldquo;Talk like that to him,
and he&rsquo;ll be offering you the choice of back or
bristles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, cut it out! I&rsquo;m serious, Bill. Please
let me be a pirate!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it, Charlie.&rdquo; Bill took him
by the arm and moved over to the rail. &ldquo;But I
do want you to do something for me,&rdquo; he said
in lowered tones. &ldquo;You must keep it entirely
to yourself, though. If you mention it to a
single soul, you&rsquo;ll get us all into a heap of
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;honest, Bill. I&rsquo;ll shut up like a
clam! What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then, I&rsquo;ll trust you. I want you
to make friends with the wireless operators.
There are two of them. Find out when they
relieve each other, whether the door is kept
locked&mdash;in fact, find out everything you can&mdash;without
making them suspicious. Got that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet. Take it from me, they&rsquo;ll never
guess what I&rsquo;m after!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attaboy! Do you know where our cabin
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s number 126 on the deck below,
starboard side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Come there at eleven tonight, and
report what you&rsquo;ve found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there with bells on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now be careful that nobody sees you come
to our door. It won&rsquo;t be locked&mdash;we&rsquo;ll be there.
Just open it and come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Bill. You can trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, so cut along now, and remember,
eleven sharp. We&rsquo;ve got a date for dinner, and
I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re going to be late as it is. So
long, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long, Bill. So long, Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie raced away, intent on the importance
of his trust and his two friends hurried toward
the Palm Garden.</p>
<p>They found the Baron and his officers awaiting
them in the foyer of the restaurant. The
Baron beamed approval on their uniforms and
introduced them to the members of the group
they had not already met. These gentlemen
each bowed from the waist and shook hands
with continental formality upon being presented.
The Baron spoke a few words, and
then as the single stroke of the ship&rsquo;s bell
clanged, the chief steward appeared in the
doorway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner is served, Herr Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron leading, they went into the restaurant.
The meal which they sat down to proved
to be a long, sumptuous affair of many courses.
Every delicacy, in and out of season, was served.
Evidently the Baron believed in living well&mdash;on
other people. Both lads did full justice to
the banquet. Muffled strains of the ship&rsquo;s orchestra,
hidden behind palms, lent gaiety to the
atmosphere, but could not cut through the rigid
formality of their companions&rsquo; demeanor.</p>
<p>It was after ten thirty by the time they left
the table and went out on deck. The stars were
like jewels flashing in the great inverted bowl of
night. The dark water gleamed quiet as a mill-pond,
reflecting the slender crescent of a new
moon that had just appeared above the horizon.</p>
<p>The Baron puffed a long cigar while he conversed
at his ease in a deck chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;This voyage,&rdquo; he remarked complacently,
watching the red ash glow on the end of his
cigar, &ldquo;is becoming quite a successful undertaking.
A few more months and we can well
afford to retire, and go our own ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely, Herr Baron, you are not contemplating
ending this splendid venture?&rdquo; It
was the Chief Engineer who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not try providence too far, Bauer.
To date, this ship is a mystery to the world at
large, it is true. But we have already created
some stir. Personally, I consider it a positive
compliment that the navies of the world are
seeking us out to destroy us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must,&rdquo; Bill remarked, &ldquo;afford you a good
deal of satisfaction, as well as profit, Baron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was becoming restive. It was nearing
eleven o&rsquo;clock. The cabin door was locked and
Charlie could not get in. But how to break
away without arousing the Baron&rsquo;s suspicions,
he could not see.</p>
<p>That gentleman puffed contemplatively for a
moment or two.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have it right, Mr. Bolton,&rdquo; he observed
at last. &ldquo;Pleasure and profit. Outside
of the vast sums in money and jewels we have
taken from captured liners, you perhaps do not
realize that we have more than two hundred
very wealthy people as passengers. Their ransoms,
at the lowest estimate will run well over
a million dollars apiece. Yes, this is a most
profitable business, Mr. Bolton. But of course,
a most dangerous one. We must not practice
it for too long a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Baron,&rdquo; Bill leaned forward in his
seat, and smiled his most engaging smile,
&ldquo;neither Chief Osceola nor I have had the opportunity
this evening to thank you for your
consideration in the matter of our cabin and the
uniforms you have provided us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, Baron,&rdquo; Osceola seconded him
and threw the stub of his cigarette over the rail.
&ldquo;Very kind of you, I must say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do not mention it, my dear fellows.&rdquo;
The Baron was joviality itself. &ldquo;Those are
small matters and easily attended to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we appreciate your wish to make us
comfortable.&rdquo; Bill rose, and Osceola followed
his example. &ldquo;And now, sir, we will say good
night. It has been a long day and a busy one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, my young friends,&rdquo; beamed
von Hiemskirk. &ldquo;Pleasant dreams, and <i>auf
wiedersehn</i> until tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone stood up and saluted and the lads
marched off toward their cabin. Osceola was
unlocking the door, when a stealthy figure appeared
from out the shadows of a cross passage,
and Charlie slipped into the room with
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I thought you were never coming,&rdquo; he
said, as Bill switched on the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Charles, so did we! Have you got
any news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty, Bill. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were cut short by a crash of gunfire
from above. For an instant they stood listening
to the thunder of the gun, then Bill broke their
constrained silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to postpone our talk, Charlie,
worse luck. There&rsquo;s something doing out there,
all right, and it&rsquo;s up to the Chief and me to
hustle up on deck pronto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further parley the three caught up
their caps and ran out of the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XI</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DANGEROUS BUSINESS</span></h2>
<p>The lads encountered a crowd of nervous and
excited passengers on the stairs and were swept
up with them and out on deck. By common instinct
the flow was toward port. A few hundred
yards away, the lights of a steamer, parallel
with them, could be discerned. Signals were
flashing, bells clanging, and the clamor of the
startled passengers pressing the rail was deafening.</p>
<p>Bill gripped Osceola&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out
of this bedlam,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The skipper is
sure to be on the bridge&mdash;come along!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Diving across the ship they ran forward on
the opposite deck and up the stair to the bridge.
Baron von Hiemskirk stood with a pair of night
glasses trained on the stranger across the water.
Near him a group of white uniformed ship&rsquo;s
officers conversed in whispers. He lowered the
binoculars as Bill and Osceola approached and
rendered them a stiff salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening again, gentlemen. Thank
you for your promptness. Chief Osceola, I
want you and Lieutenant Schneider to go aft
and quiet that rabble. Explain to the passengers
that there is no cause for alarm. Tell them also
in my name that unless they go at once to their
cabins, they will be sent there forcibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola and the Lieutenant saluted and departed
on their errand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; continued the Baron, &ldquo;as
several of you already know, I have been aware
for some time that we were overhauling that
ship we see out there. Had she obeyed our
signals and those of the <i>Flying Fish</i>, there would
have been no need to waste shell fire on her.
You will be interested to learn that she is the
<i>Blake</i> of Cardiff, loaded with twenty-five hundred
tons of coal&mdash;enough to keep us going for a
week at good speed, or two weeks at low speed.
Tomorrow morning, we will start coaling, and
for the next few days, every one of us will be
especially busy. Those of you who are not on
duty, will please me by turning in at once, and
getting a good night&rsquo;s rest. Good night, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back in his cabin, Bill undressed and got into
bed. He was lying there, with the lights burning,
thinking over the day&rsquo;s events, when Osceola
came in.</p>
<p>He tossed his cap on the lounge, and began
to unbutton his blouse. &ldquo;Well, we got the sheep
herded into their respective barns. Did you find
out anything about that ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill told him what the Baron had said.
&ldquo;Filthy business, coaling,&rdquo; he ended with a
yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be interesting to find out how they
work it at sea, especially when we&rsquo;ve got at least
one warship on our trail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the Baron&rsquo;s worrying about
the <i>Stamford</i>. We&rsquo;ve changed our course at
least twice in the last few hours. It&rsquo;s a big
ocean, Osceola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess so. And some queer people on it.
The noble Baron makes me laugh. He&rsquo;s probably
the greatest thief unhung, yet he purposely
chatted with us and the other officers after dinner,
on the side of the deck away from this
collier, so that we would go to bed early and get
a good night&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an odd beggar, all right,&rdquo; yawned Bill.
&ldquo;Switch off the light, and hop into that bed of
yours, big boy, or I&rsquo;ll be talking in my sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>A steward called them at five next morning.
By five-thirty they had dressed in uniform cap
and dungarees, breakfasted and were out on
deck. The collier was now steaming slowly
alongside the big liner. The ships were kept
together by a hawser across the lips of the
<i>Amtonia&rsquo;s</i> bows, supplemented by a few lines
across her poop; and a speed of two miles an
hour was being maintained by both vessels. This
kept their noses together. It also gave them a
certain steadiness in the choppy sea that ran
this morning. Above all, it kept the pirate ship
constantly prepared, steamed up in readiness to
dash away in case an enemy cruiser appeared.
The lads noted that at each of the cables which
held the vessels together, a man was stationed,
ax in hand, to cut the strands should the emergency
arise.</p>
<p>Bill and Osceola soon found that preparations
for coaling on the high seas had already
been made. Through the decks of the <i>Amtonia</i>
the carpenters had cut large circular holes, one
directly beneath the other. In these openings,
ship&rsquo;s ventilator tubes were at that moment
being inserted. They were then spliced together
in such a manner that coal dumped on
to the deck merely had to be pushed into the
tubes to slide swiftly down into the bunkers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Three temporary derricks had been erected,
one fore, another amidships, and one aft, all
electrically equipped. Bill was presently put
in charge of the fore derrick, while Osceola
crossed over to the collier, where he helped to
superintend the loading of sacks and baskets
with coal. These when filled were transferred
from the <i>Blake&rsquo;s</i> derricks to those of the liner,
in midair. The coal was then unloaded on the
<i>Amtonia&rsquo;s</i> deck and shoveled into the tubes by
the crew.</p>
<p>As the sun grew higher, the weather became
increasingly hotter. So hot was this work of
coaling that the men were soon working clad
only in pantaloons, cut short like boys&rsquo; trousers,
or even in tights. There were no feminine eyes
about, for all passengers were being kept below,
so that occasionally the scanty loincloths were
cast aside and the men worked naked. Covered
from head to foot with sweat and coal dust, they
soon looked like gangs of negroes. The officers
fared quite as badly, for, though they were
spared manual labor and so did not discard their
uniforms, they soon became as grimy as the men
and fully as uncomfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Work was carried forward night and day, in
alternate watches. To Bill it became a nightmare
of heat and sweat and coal dust. The
ship, usually so immaculate, took on the appearance
of a coalyard, and the fine black dust filtered
into even the remotest nooks and crannies.
When relieved of duty, the black counterpart
of that smart young Lieutenant Bolton would
satisfy his hunger at a buffet, get under a shower
and then to bed. Here, between coal dust coated
sheets, he would snatch a few hours sleep&mdash;then
hurry above for his next trick at the derrick.
He began to find out that the life of an
officer aboard this pirate craft was not the bed
of roses it had first appeared to be. As Osceola
worked and ate and slept on board the <i>Blake</i>,
the two saw nothing of each other.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon of the third day, the last
of the twenty-five hundred tons of coal was
transferred and shovelled down the chutes. Bill
saw to the taking down of his derrick and then
went below to his cabin, thankful that the dirty
job had come to an end. He was getting out of
filthy clothes when Osceola walked in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Coolheavers ahoy!&rdquo; he greeted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m one
black warrior, if you ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve had pleasanter jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve had a nice, comfortable deck to
work on,&rdquo; returned the Chief, diving into the
bathroom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve nothing to complain about.
I haven&rsquo;t had these clothes off since the day before
yesterday! Been working down in the hold
of that collier at a temperature that blew the
top off our thermometer.&rdquo; His voice was
drowned by the sound of the shower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is tough! I missed you, old fellow.
Where did you sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did I sleep!&rdquo; spluttered the Chief.
&ldquo;Not in a downy white bed like you&mdash;you son
of luxury! I slept, or rather, I tried to sleep in
a ship&rsquo;s hammock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill chuckled, and began to unlace his shoes.
&ldquo;Pretty difficult to navigate until you get on
to them. Hard to get into&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Harder still to stay put when you&rsquo;re
once in the darned thing! Gosh-all-hemlock,
this water is sure a sweet, cool dream, of Paradise!
Let me tell you that my hammock had
to be slung between-decks&mdash;iron decks, at that.
Sleep! I&rsquo;ve forgotten what it is. Every time
I moved in that hammock, the confounded thing
dumped me onto that dirty iron deck with a jar
that nearly split my head! Push that bell for
a steward, please. I want food and plenty of it,
and I&rsquo;m going to eat it in my comfortable bed.
Then, I&rsquo;m going to sleep <i>and</i> sleep until tomorrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who says so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have your supper, by all means, and have it
in bed if you like&mdash;but you and I have a date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Date nothing! Keep it yourself. I&rsquo;m only
a poor Indian pirate. Neither am I popular
with first class passengers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not&mdash;but this date isn&rsquo;t with a passenger.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten the wireless operator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! Do you have to pull that stunt tonight?
I&rsquo;m half dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are a few other people. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
going to pull it off tonight. Snap out of it, old
man. The fortunes, if not the lives of a lot of
people depend on what we&rsquo;re able to accomplish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are we going to do? You never
have spilled that plan of yours. Not to me, anyhow.&rdquo;
He came into the cabin, drying himself
with a bath towel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You order your chow,&rdquo; suggested Bill. &ldquo;If
you haven&rsquo;t used all the hot water aboard ship, I
want to get under that shower myself. When
I&rsquo;m dressed and you&rsquo;re in your right mind, I&rsquo;ve
got to hunt up Charlie and see what he&rsquo;s found
out. We&rsquo;ll be back later and I&rsquo;ll explain the job
in detail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>He disappeared into the bathroom, closing
the door after him to cut short further argument.
It was after seven o&rsquo;clock by the time
Bill was dressed and ready to go on deck. He
knew that Charlie would be in the passengers&rsquo;
dining salon, and that was out of bounds for the
ship&rsquo;s officers. So leaving Osceola attending to
a substantial dinner in bed, he went above to the
Palm Garden, where the officers&rsquo; mess was held.</p>
<p>It was not a talkative crowd at dinner that
evening. Every man at the table was dog tired
and conversation flagged in consequence. The
meal with its many courses seemed interminable
to Bill. When at last it was over, he excused
himself, while the others were smoking cigars
and sipping liqueurs and went in search of young
Evans.</p>
<p>Weary sailors were hard at work with hose
and swabs on the promenade deck, getting rid of
the accumulated grime of the coaling. Bill
took a turn round to the opposite side of the ship,
where he encountered a similar gang at work,
but found no passengers about. Charlie was not
in the smoking room. Eventually he found
him, listening to the orchestra, which was playing
in the lounge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Without appearing to recognize the youngster,
he caught his eye as he sauntered past, surreptitiously
crooked a finger and went down to
his cabin. There he found Osceola fast asleep
in his bed, with all lights burning. He was wondering
whether he should wake him then and
there, or let him sleep, when Charlie softly
opened the door and entered.</p>
<p>Bill put a hand up for silence, and led him
into the bathroom. &ldquo;Better let the poor Chief
get some rest,&rdquo; he said, closing the door. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
been going it night and day aboard that collier.
He needs the sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s a cinch! We&rsquo;ve been
kept off the decks ever since you fellows started
coaling, and sleep was the only thing left to do.
Say&mdash;did you see the <i>Blake</i> go down?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. I was sure they&rsquo;d sink her, though, for
the Baron told me he was going to take her captain
and crew aboard the <i>Amtonia</i> and dispose
of her as soon as we got her coal. When did it
happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just before dinner&mdash;about quarter to seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was cleaning up in here then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I got a peach of a view from the smoking
room windows, with Dad&rsquo;s field glasses.
They cut the ropes and she drifted away from
us. It wasn&rsquo;t five minutes later, when she gave
a great lurch and went down bow first. It certainly
is a crime, the way the Baron sinks good
ships. I guess he had dynamite planted on board
just like he did with the <i>Merrymaid</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely. But there&rsquo;s nothing we can do
about it, Charlie. Not yet awhile. But tell
me, what have you found out about that wireless
room?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since that first evening when we captured
the <i>Blake</i>, I haven&rsquo;t been able to get up
there. But I did manage to get in soon after the
gunfire that night. I copped a couple of Dad&rsquo;s
cigars and gave &rsquo;em to the guy who was on duty.
These Heinies are a leadpipe cinch to kid. He
isn&rsquo;t such a bad guy at that&mdash;showed me the
whole business&mdash;everything he had. I began
to think he&rsquo;s a swell fellow even if he is a pirate.
I got a book on telegraphy out of the library and
I&rsquo;ve been boning up on the Morse Code ever
since. That and sleeping. Say, I bet I could
send a message now. Receiving&rsquo;s not so easy,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure I can, Bill&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;I believe you&mdash;but lay off it. I
want the dope first. How many operators does
this ship run to? Did you find that out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. There&rsquo;s three of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long are their watches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four hours each. But sometimes they&rsquo;re on
for eight hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there are two on duty daytimes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that either&mdash;I&rsquo;m not interested
in their complete schedule. How many operators
are in the wireless room now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only one. He&rsquo;s doing his trick from eight
till midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere.
How about from midnight on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another guy comes on duty then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till eight in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alone all that time? Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The other two lads relieve him then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the operator who will go on
at twelve tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not sure. They vary their
watches, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Bill said to
himself. &ldquo;Tell me, is the door kept locked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but they generally keep it shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the night operator sit facing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. His back is toward the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that window in the wireless house
must be to his right when he&rsquo;s sending or receiving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s sure to be open now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Charlie. You&rsquo;ve done splendidly.
Run along to bed now. Osceola and I will attend
to your friend later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to let
me in on this?&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Oh, Bill, gee&mdash;I
did all the work and you two are going to have
all the fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much fun about it.&rdquo; Bill grinned and
was silent for a minute. &ldquo;Well, I reckon we
can use you. But you must remember that this
is a very serious and dangerous business, Charlie.
If anything goes wrong, von Hiemskirk is quite
likely to have us shot out of hand. You&rsquo;ll have
to obey orders to the letter, and take no chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Bill, of course, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Then go to your cabin and turn in.
And be back here at one o&rsquo;clock sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie&rsquo;s face was transformed with joy.
&ldquo;Thanks, Bill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run along now,&rdquo; directed the older lad.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lot to do before then. And be sure
nobody sees you going or coming.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; promised the youngster.
&ldquo;Say, are we going to shoot this operator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, you bloodthirsty wretch.
None of us will have guns. Neither Osceola
nor I have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>are</i> we going to do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obey orders, kid. Get out of here now&mdash;I&rsquo;m
busy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XII</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE JOB</span></h2>
<p>When Charlie had gone, Bill glanced at his
wrist watch. It was just ten minutes to nine.
With a sigh of satisfaction, he picked up his
cap. Then, snapping off the electrics in the
bathroom and the cabin, he, too, went out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>It had been impossible for him to make
preparations for this venture of his since its
inception at the beginning of the week. As he
went out on deck and forward toward the bridge,
he could hardly believe that no longer ago than
Monday morning, he had been flying his amphibian
north to New York, with Osceola as
passenger. Then had come the <i>Merrymaid</i>,
and capture by these pirates, their flying submarine
and the raider, this huge liner whose
decks he was walking. That afternoon had
come the <i>Orleans</i> affair; in the evening the collier
<i>Blake</i> had been taken. Tonight, only
Thursday. After the monotony of three days&rsquo;
coaling, the adventures of Monday seemed far
away, except when he stopped to realize that
ever since then he had had no leisure whatsoever
to develop his plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, sir.&rdquo; The guard at the foot
of the stair that led to the bridge saluted, and
Bill came back to the actual present with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Schmidt.&rdquo; He returned the
man&rsquo;s salute, and recognized him as one of his
derrick&rsquo;s crew. &ldquo;You look so spick and span
I didn&rsquo;t know you at first glance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo; Schmidt smiled, keeping
his rifle at present. &ldquo;And I feel a good bit more
comfortable this way, sir. Coaling is filthy
work, Lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing dirtier.&rdquo; Bill nodded and passed
on up the stairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Above he found Lieutenant Schneider pacing
slowly up and down. &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said
Bill. &ldquo;Mind if I join you for a few minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be honored, Herr Lieutenant,&rdquo; returned
the officer. &ldquo;An unlooked-for pleasure.
A beautiful night, is it not? But I surmised
that like the rest of the mess you turned in directly
after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; Bill went on chattily,
&ldquo;quite as tired as the other chaps, after the grind
of the last few days. Chief Osceola was completely
done up. Had his dinner in bed, and
I found him sound asleep when I went below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of bed,&rdquo; grumbled the officer.
&ldquo;I wish I were there now. It is just my luck to
be on duty tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found the cabin hot and stuffy, so I thought
I&rsquo;d come up for a breath of air before turning
in. Heading more to northward, since we sank
the <i>Blake</i>, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the course is nor&rsquo;nor&rsquo;east now. Captain
von Hiemskirk is heading the ship for the
transatlantic passenger ship lane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t seem to be in any hurry, Lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, our speed is only sixteen knots. Everybody
needs a rest, and the Herr Baron, being a
wise man, is saving coal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds foolish of me, a ship&rsquo;s officer, to
admit it, but I honestly have only the haziest
idea of our position now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at that,&rdquo; laughed Schneider.
&ldquo;The way we changed our course during the
past week would make a snake break its back.
At noon today we were in latitude 38 degrees
north, longitude 62 degrees west&mdash;and we aren&rsquo;t
far from there now at the rate we&rsquo;ve been steaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm&mdash;I thought we were much farther
east,&rdquo; remarked Bill, and then changed the
subject.</p>
<p>As he had now gained the information he
wanted, he chatted for ten minutes more with
young Schneider, then, wishing him good night,
went below to his cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Here he set the tiny alarm on his watch for
twelve-thirty. From the closet, he brought
forth a civilian suit of his own, and one of Osceola&rsquo;s.
These, together with two pairs of tennis
shoes and two soft felt hats that he found
in their bags, he placed on the lounge. Again
he dug into the bottom of a kit bag and pulled
forth a coil of rope, two monkey wrenches and
a flashlight. Placing these conveniently near
the clothing, he began to undress. Osceola still
slept the sleep of exhaustion. Without awaking
him, Bill crept into his bed and turned off the
light.</p>
<p>It seemed but a moment or two later, though
in reality three hours had crept away, when the
tinkle of his alarm bell brought Bill back to a
sleepy realization of the job before him. He
switched off the alarm and sat up in bed. Osceola&rsquo;s
voice cut the throbbing drone of the
ship&rsquo;s machinery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big idea?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time to get on the job,&rdquo; Bill murmured in a
low tone. &ldquo;Had you forgotten it? Don&rsquo;t turn
on the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten. You said something
about working out a plan of yours tonight. But
can&rsquo;t we put it off for twenty-four hours? I&rsquo;m
bleary-eyed, I&rsquo;m so tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill got out of bed. &ldquo;So is everybody else
aboard this packet. And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re pulling
it off tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tossed Osceola&rsquo;s clothes on to the chief&rsquo;s
bed. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an old suit of yours&mdash;get into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you say so&mdash;&rdquo; yawned his friend.
&ldquo;What are we going to do with those wrenches?
Crack the Baron&rsquo;s safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pair of eyes you&rsquo;ve got! I&rsquo;d forgotten
you could see in the dark. No, you big
galoot, this is not robbery you&rsquo;re in for now.
We&rsquo;re going to tie up the wireless operator.
I want to do some broadcasting on my
own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the way the wind blows!&rdquo; Osceola,
fully awake now, was pulling on his
trousers. &ldquo;I have to hand it to you, boy, when it
comes to action&mdash;you act!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on&mdash;I know it&rsquo;s risky business, but if
we&rsquo;re ever going to break up this nest of pirates,
we&rsquo;ve got to have help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to wire our position to that
cruiser who was on our trail Monday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to whomever else it may concern&mdash;yes,
that&rsquo;s the idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola grunted. &ldquo;And what is the Herr
Baron going to be doing to us while the cruiser
is trying to catch us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a blooming thing, if the wireless man
doesn&rsquo;t spot who we are. I&rsquo;ve got a couple of
handkerchiefs cut with slits for eyeholes. We
can drape them over our lovely features just
like real thugs, when we get on deck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; responded his companion. &ldquo;Gimme
one of those wrenches. I&rsquo;m all set if you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill glanced at the luminous dial of his
watch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give him three minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give who three minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie&rsquo;s coming with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Not that crazy kid! He&rsquo;s sure to
gum the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t. And we need a lookout, Osceola.
The youngster worked like a hero, getting
dope about the wireless routine. I know
it&rsquo;s a responsibility to let him take the risk&mdash;but
the chap was so keen on being in at the death&mdash;I
simply hadn&rsquo;t the heart to refuse him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so long as this is your party, I&rsquo;ll say
no more about dragging Charlie into it. But I&rsquo;d
hate to be you if his mother finds out what
you&rsquo;ve let him in for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A crack of light appeared under the door, and
Charlie opened it, slipped inside and closed the
door behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Osceola whispered back,
&ldquo;why, I thought it was Christmas Eve and Santa
Claus had come to fill my stocking!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Try the other side of your bed when you get
up next time, Chief,&rdquo; Charlie snickered. &ldquo;Why
the grouch? Don&rsquo;t lose your nerve. If anybody
tries to hurt you, I&rsquo;ll put salt on his tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola laughed good-humoredly. &ldquo;You
young scamp, if you don&rsquo;t cut the comedy and
do what you&rsquo;re told tonight, you&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;ve
had salt rubbed on yours, along with the hiding
you&rsquo;ll get from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar she blows! thar she blows!&rdquo; teased
Charlie. &ldquo;What a whale of a guy you are,
Chief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe down&mdash;both of you!&rdquo; commanded
Bill. &ldquo;You make more noise than an old maid&rsquo;s
tea party. What do you want to do&mdash;wake up
the ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s shove off then,&rdquo; said Charlie in a
lower tone, and started for the door.</p>
<p>Bill caught his arm. &ldquo;Not that way,&rdquo; he
warned. &ldquo;The ports to this cabin are regular
windows, and we&rsquo;re going out through them.
There&rsquo;s less chance of being seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I lock the door?&rdquo; asked Osceola.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. If we&rsquo;re able to pull this off, it will
be a case of speed in getting back here. The
door may be handier then. Come on&mdash;mum&rsquo;s
the word. I&rsquo;ll go first&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped onto the window seat. A moment
later he was through the broad porthole,
and out on deck. Not a soul was in sight. A
nod to Osceola brought the Chief to his side and
they waited until Charlie reached the deck.</p>
<p>With Bill in the lead, they walked swiftly
forward until they came to the open stair leading
up to the boat deck. Motioning caution,
Bill went silently up the rubber-coated treads
with the others close behind. He knew that
once above, they would be in plain sight of the
bridge. Therefore, before reaching the stairhead,
he dropped to his knees and crawled up to
the deck level, careful to keep his head below
the skyline. Then, turning back to Charlie, he
drew the boy&rsquo;s head close to his lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to stay here!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;If
anyone comes off the bridge and makes for this
stair, run down to the deck below and get out
of his way. When he&rsquo;s gone, come back here.
If anyone comes up the stair, crawl into the
shadow of that lifeboat. If you see anybody at
all going toward the wireless house, whistle
twice and beat it back to your cabin, no matter
what occurs. Got it clear, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie, tense with excitement and proud of
the responsibility given him, nodded mutely.
Then he moved to one side while Osceola slipped
past him, to lie beside Bill.</p>
<p>Diagonally across the deck from the stairhead
aft of the ship&rsquo;s second funnel was a small
superstructure, the little wireless house. Light
shone through the open window at the forward
end of the structure. Charlie, who had never
seen an Indian travel over an open space when
the red man didn&rsquo;t wish to be seen, was surprised
to see Bill and Osceola move forward flat on
their stomachs. With the sinuous, wriggling
motion of snakes, the two slid across the starlit
deck. In a few moments he lost sight of them
in the shadow of the ship&rsquo;s great funnel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;That sure is some stunt.
Some day I&rsquo;ve got to get one of those guys to
show me how they do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the obscurity of deep shadow, the two
plotters got to their feet and adjusted their
masks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you see all right?&rdquo; whispered Bill. &ldquo;I
wasn&rsquo;t sure about the eyeholes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see. What next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get that lad in the wireless house from the
window. I&rsquo;ll take the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you. I&rsquo;ll wait until I hear you
speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keeping always within the shadow cast by
the big stack, and careful to avoid the broad ray
of light from the open window, Osceola glided
swiftly toward his goal.</p>
<p>The blond young man who sat at the open
window, dozing, with a magazine in his lap,
awoke with a start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stick up your hands and keep them there!&rdquo;
muttered a low voice.</p>
<p>Just outside the window, the dazed operator
saw a white-faced blur in the darkness. The
grim figure behind the mask held a black object
pointed directly at his head.</p>
<p>Like most North Germans, the wireless expert
was a sensible young man. He held up his
hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XIII</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">RESULTS</span></h2>
<p>The <i>Amtonia&rsquo;s</i> wireless operator heard the
door at his back open and shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand up!&rdquo; ordered a harsh voice.</p>
<p>The man obeyed immediately, his magazine
slipping to the floor. He did not turn to look
at this second speaker. The shiny black object
in the hand of the ominous figure outside the
window held his eyes like an electric magnet.</p>
<p>The chair in which he had been dozing was
whisked away. Strong hands gripped his
wrists, brought his arms downward. With a
speed and thoroughness that bespoke nautical
experience, a rope lashed his arms behind his
back, first at the elbows and then at the wrists.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Next, a cloth was bound over his eyes. A
gag, made of a rolled-up handkerchief was
stuffed in his mouth and fastened by a band of
cloth tied at the back of his head. He felt wads
of cotton being placed in his ears and his ankles
were then strapped together. He was grasped
by the shoulders, caught round the knees and
lifted to a narrow couch where a cushion was
slipped under his head. Deaf, dumb and blind,
he nevertheless knew that he lay on the locker
which ran along the farther side of the room.
He also knew that locker to be little more than
a narrow shelf, and at least four feet from the
floor. If he moved an inch, he&rsquo;d get a tumble.
He therefore lay still and tried to imagine which
of the passengers he had to thank for his present
predicament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Osceola, studying
the bound figure on the locker. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky he
didn&rsquo;t try to put up a fight. Things might have
got messy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have, in his place?&rdquo; Bill was
taking in the details of the room and spoke rather
absently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;can&rsquo;t say I would. The poor beggar
was scared stiff. That wrench stunt was a
happy thought. In the darkness, I guess it
passed darned well for an automatic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, look at the map on the wall over there.
These lads certainly have a system!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are those colored pins stuck all over it
supposed to be&mdash;ships?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Ships within a radius of several hundred
miles that have been sending out radio
messages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how does he do it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess our little operator is clever all
right. I&rsquo;m no wireless expert and there are a
lot of gadgets in here that I don&rsquo;t understand.
Undoubtedly they&rsquo;re delicate instruments by
which the operator is able to determine the approximate
distance and direction of any ship
sending out messages. You see, he keeps this
map constantly before him, charted with the
probable positions of ships. He changes the
pins when his new readings seem to be in error.
This is how the noble Baron knows exactly what
is going on in his neighborhood. Just as if he
were looking down on the sea from the moon
with a telescope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That list up there beside the chart is the
key to the colored pins, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. There&rsquo;s the <i>Stamford</i>.&rdquo; Bill pointed
to a gray pin. &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s where I get busy.
The sooner that cruiser is put wise to our position,
the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you find out where we are?&rdquo;
Osceola looked his surprise. &ldquo;When have you
had a chance to shoot the sun? Do you keep a
pocket sextant up your sleeve? Or are you just
guessing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like that. A sight must be taken
when the sun reaches it&rsquo;s highest point. I got the
dope tonight from Schneider. While you were
asleep, I went on the bridge and got him to give
me our position this noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s more than twelve hours ago!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. But I also found out the speed
and direction we&rsquo;ve been steaming this afternoon
and evening. Where we are now is a
simple sum in arithmetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, fella, when we&rsquo;re out of this mess, I&rsquo;ll
take a week or two off and go into detail. But
right now, I&rsquo;ve got to raise the <i>Stamford</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down in the chair before the sending
apparatus and adjusted the earphones. Then
his left hand sought the sending key and the
room was filled with the crash and snap of
electric discharges.</p>
<p>Osceola took up a pencil and pad from the
table. For a moment he scribbled, then placed
the written sheet in front of Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go easy!&rdquo; the message read. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wake
up the whole ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill smiled and shook his head. He was sending
call after call out for the <i>Stamford</i>. In his
right hand he held a pencil. Presently Osceola&rsquo;s
note was passed back with a few lines scrawled
below his own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. These fellows are continually
sending out fake messages in order to
gain information from other ships. I&rsquo;ve heard
them. If nothing was sent during this watch,
somebody on the bridge would be sure to smell
a rat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola drew up a chair and sat down.
Fascinated, he watched Bill&rsquo;s left hand pressing
the sending key, calling&mdash;calling&mdash;calling.
The young Seminole&rsquo;s education had been academic,
not scientific, and his knowledge of
radio was only rudimentary. Although the
International Morse Code of dash-dot letters
was as much of a mystery to him as it is to the
average layman, he soon realized that his friend
was sending out the same short message over
and over again.</p>
<p>Suddenly Bill lifted his hand from the key.
He smiled at Osceola, nodded and commenced
to write hurriedly on the pad before him.
The Seminole leaned over and watched
intently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the <i>Stamford</i>. Who calls?&rdquo; he
read.</p>
<p>Again Bill&rsquo;s supple fingers pressed out an
answer&mdash;a long one this time. And for the
next fifteen minutes the crash and crackle of
an electric storm reverberated through the
room.</p>
<p>Presently he stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You raised the cruiser, I take it.&rdquo; Osceola
only half stifled a yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did that, old sport!&rdquo; Bill was delighted
with his success. &ldquo;Got all the dope over in
great style. Told the operator aboard her who
I was and a short story of our capture. Dad
probably thinks we were both lost at sea, you
know. The <i>Stamford</i>, will relay a message, assuring
him of our safety. Then I tapped out
details of this ship, the <i>Flying Fish</i>, their crews
and armament. Last of all I gave our position,
course and speed. By this time, she and some
other craft of Uncle Sam&rsquo;s are making tracks
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure a right smart feller, Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill laughed. &ldquo;I agree with you, Big
Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About when do you reckon they&rsquo;ll catch up
with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime tomorrow&mdash;or, rather, this afternoon.
And then&mdash;boy, oh, boy! There will
be one sweet little rough house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll probably be one aboard this sweet
little packet as you call her, before that,&rdquo;
prophesied the Seminole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Herr Baron is sure to raise an awful
stink when he finds that lad on the locker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should fret over that. We&rsquo;ll both be
sleeping the sleep of the just long before that
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I vote we get out of here and right
now. This ain&rsquo;t a healthy place for either you
or me. And say, I&rsquo;m dead enough to go to
sleep under an ice-cold shower!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. We don&rsquo;t want to leave
any clues. Grab that paper I was writing on,
will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he talked. Bill was busily engaged in undoing
nuts and screws which he stuffed in his
pockets, snapping wires and playing general
havoc with the radio apparatus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smash that line of glass jars on the shelf
with your wrench,&rdquo; he added, bringing his own
down on the sending key with a crash. &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t going to be any radio business aboard the
<i>Amtonia</i> when our friends arrive, if I can help
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to stop the <i>Flying Fish</i> getting wise
with their wireless?&rdquo; inquired Osceola, who
was systematically wrecking everything within
reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they haven&rsquo;t much of a wireless outfit
aboard the sub. This bunch of junk in here was
the one that counted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bunch of junk is right&mdash;&rdquo; Osceola
stopped short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>He stood facing a small mirror that hung on
the wall above the wet cells he had just destroyed.
Reflected in the small oblong he saw
the door to the deck open slowly&mdash;and Baron
von Hiemskirk walked into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he exclaimed harshly. &ldquo;Passengers&mdash;mutiny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got no further. As Osceola jumped for
the switch to snap off the light, Bill dived
through the air, tackling the commander just
above his knees. There came a crash as the
Baron&rsquo;s head hit the deck&mdash;then darkness.</p>
<p>Osceola ran to the doorway. The Baron lay
prone. Bill was bending over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine&mdash;ten&mdash;out!&rdquo; said that young gentleman
rather breathlessly. &ldquo;Grab his legs, big
boy. We&rsquo;ll move him inside. It&rsquo;s a little too
public out here for comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they carried the big man into the
wireless house and deposited him on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bight of rope,&rdquo; said Bill, switching
on the light again. &ldquo;Tie up his ankles&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
attend to his wrists.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we gag him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s breathing pretty hard. Slight
concussion, probably. The back of his head hit
the decking an awful crack. I don&rsquo;t want him
to choke to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola finished lashing the Baron&rsquo;s legs
together and stood up. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a right powerful
brute. Got a pair of legs like tree-trunks.
Say,&rdquo; he began to laugh, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think our job
would be done up as brown as all this tonight!
That was a swell tackle of yours. The longer
he&rsquo;s out the better pleased I&rsquo;ll be. That guy
has never made a hit with me. I&rsquo;m only sorry
I didn&rsquo;t get a crack at him. If you&rsquo;ve got an
extra wipe, pass it over. A blindfold won&rsquo;t
stop his breathing, and there&rsquo;s no need for him
to know where he is when he wakes up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ve unhooked the collar of his
blouse,&rdquo; Bill said, surveying their captive
critically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do. Give me a hand with
the other guy, now. I&rsquo;m going to take out his
gag and give him a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;Going to leave it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;m no inquisitor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about it when the pair of them
start yelling for help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the door and window shut, this place
is pretty well soundproof. Anyway, the Baron
isn&rsquo;t likely to kick up much of a row&mdash;not for
a couple of days yet, if I know the signs. The
operator couldn&rsquo;t hear him if he did. I&rsquo;m
leaving the cotton in his ears. Make it snappy&mdash;I
want to beat it while the going&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, two dark figures crossed
the boat deck to the stairhead, ran lightly down
and after climbing into their cabin by way of
the open port, hurriedly undressed in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; Osceola paused in the act of removing
a shoe. &ldquo;I wonder what became of
Charlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess he&rsquo;s all right. I told him to
vamoose if it looked like he&rsquo;d get caught. He&rsquo;s
probably sound asleep in his bunk by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hope so. He&rsquo;s a sassy brat, but I wouldn&rsquo;t
want him to get into trouble with the lads who
run this ship. They&rsquo;re likely to turn nasty
when they find their beloved Baron has cracked
his nut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;is quite capable of
taking care of himself. Put away those clothes
you were wearing. If anybody comes snooping
round here looking for clues, those civvies
would give us away. I&rsquo;m pretty sure His Nibs
didn&rsquo;t recognize us. I ducked my head and
the brim of my hat threw my face in shadow.
You had your back turned. Too bad, though,
we&rsquo;d pocketed our masks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound!&rdquo; Osceola sprang for the door.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go up there again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what on earth for? Leave well enough
alone, guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to&mdash;it&rsquo;s those handkerchiefs of
yours, Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ones we used as blindfolds? By gosh,
you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. And we were idiots not to
remember that all your wipes are initialled!
Well, that was a bloomer we both made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill crawled into bed, and pulled up the
sheet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he retorted sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Har-har! Had you goin&rsquo;, didn&rsquo;t I? Why,
I changed the one on the wireless lad&mdash;found
two in the Baron&rsquo;s pockets, y&rsquo; see. The one you
used on him was his own&mdash;the other&rsquo;s on his
little roommate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m a son-of-a-seacook! That&rsquo;s a
good one. I wonder if the rest of the bunch will
figure that &lsquo;they done it all themselves&rsquo;? Smart
work, Bill. You&rsquo;re as full of ideas as Martinengo&rsquo;s
ship&rsquo;s biscuit was of weevils!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right the first and last time. Now shut up!
I&rsquo;m asleep.&rdquo; Bill turned over, his back to the
room, and buried his face in his pillow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XIV</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TROUBLE AHEAD</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that someone pounding the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell &rsquo;em!&rdquo; sleepily suggested the chief,
covering his face with a pajamaed arm to shut
out the morning light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; Bill groaned and crawled out
of bed. He glanced at his wrist watch. It was
exactly seven-thirty.</p>
<p>He unlocked the door and a steward clicked
his heels together and stood at attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; growled Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commander Geibel&rsquo;s compliments, sir&mdash;and
will the gentlemen be good enough to meet
him at half past eight in the executive office
for officers&rsquo; conference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-o. Give Commander Geibel our
compliments&mdash;and say we&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill shut the door, and looked over at Osceola.
The chief was fast asleep again. Bill went into
the bathroom, where an ice-cold shower worked
wonders. When he returned to the cabin after
a strenuous rub with a rough towel, he carried
a dripping sponge with which he scientifically
massaged Osceola&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey there! Cut it out!&rdquo; The chief
sprang from his bed as though he had had an
electric shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the huge idea?&rdquo; he stormed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Exec.&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;wants to see us at
eight-thirty sharp. It is now seven-forty-four.
And we both want breakfast, I expect.
Get under a shower and you won&rsquo;t feel so
crabby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; Osceola was considerably subdued
by this news. &ldquo;Think he smells a rat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not a chance, so far as we&rsquo;re concerned.
We&rsquo;d be in the brig by this time if he did!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; yawned Osceola, scowling
furiously as he stretched the kinks out of his
powerful arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hop to it, then. I&rsquo;m nearly dressed&mdash;and
I&rsquo;m hungry enough to eat shoe-leather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right&mdash;don&rsquo;t lose your shirt
over it. I&rsquo;ll be with you in a jiffy.&rdquo; The bathroom
door slammed and again came the sound of
rushing water as the shower was turned on.</p>
<p>At eight-thirty sharp the two lads found
Commander Geibel seated at his desk in the
Executive Office, and took their places among
the other ship&rsquo;s officers. There was none of
the joviality which usually preambled these
meetings. The <i>Amtonia&rsquo;s</i> commissioned personnel
seemed utterly mute this morning. Instead
of the accustomed good-natured chaff, the
various officers merely nodded to each other as
they took their places and sat down. Bill
noticed that all wore expressions of deep
solemnity, yet the atmosphere of the cabin was
charged with a current of tense excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>The nautical clock on the wall struck one
bell. Commander Geibel, who had been
studying papers on his desk blotter, came to
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen&mdash;&rdquo; he leaned forward, one hand
on the papers before him, &ldquo;I have here the report
of first assistant wireless operator, Miller.
Had I not seen Miller when he was first found
with our beloved captain, I could not have believed
this outrage possible. We, who have
prided ourselves on the most efficient and strict
discipline maintained on this ship, can no longer
be proud. As a number of you gentlemen
already know, at about one o&rsquo;clock this morning,
two passengers who were masked overpowered
Miller in the wireless room and wrecked the
premises. While these vandals were at work,
the Herr Captain, Baron von Hiemskirk,
entered the room, where these ruffians surprised
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, sir,&rdquo; interrupted the ship&rsquo;s first
lieutenant, Lieutenant-Commander Beerman.
&ldquo;It is rumored that the Herr Baron is seriously
injured. Will you be good enough to ease our
minds concerning the Herr Baron&rsquo;s condition?
I understand that he was knocked unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so, Herr Beerman. I regret to tell
you gentlemen that he is still unconscious, and
may continue in that state for a day or two.
Doctor Thierfelder diagnoses his condition as
concussion&mdash;a slight concussion only, I am
thankful to say. The Herr Doctor, who is with
him now, believes that Baron von Hiemskirk
received a blow from a blunt instrument.
Luckily, his service cap partially protected his
head. With care, and no complications, our
Captain will probably be able to get about again
within a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; inquired Bill, &ldquo;what punishment
has been meted out to the perpetrators of
this dastardly crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say that they have not been
apprehended, Lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you spoke of two passengers,
Herr Commander?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miller states that the two men were dressed
in civilian clothes. One of them at least had
a revolver with which he menaced the operator,
while the other bound him. As you know, every
passenger, upon boarding this ship, was searched
and his luggage thoroughly inspected for arms.
Another search of their cabins has been made
this morning. No weapons of any description
have been found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Schneider caught the Commander&rsquo;s
attention. &ldquo;I was on the bridge while
this crime was being committed. During that
time, I am certain that messages were radioed
from the wireless room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very important fact, Herr Schneider, and
one confirmed by Miller. Due to the cotton that
had been placed in his ears, he was unable to decipher
anything, but he is convinced that one or
more messages were sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could we not ascertain who among the passengers
is capable of sending such messages?&rdquo;
It was the Chief Engineer who spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>The Executive Officer shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course all possible suspects will be
questioned,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I doubt, however, if we
can learn much. Fifteen of our passengers are
yacht owners. Three more are high executives
of broadcasting corporations. Any of these
men may understand wireless. On the other
hand, all of them will probably deny it. But
this is not so important. Outside of broadcasting
a description of this ship, they can have
sent little or no information, as they have no
possible means of ascertaining the ship&rsquo;s position.
I must urge you all, nevertheless, to be
more than ever on the alert. Now, one thing
more, and we may go to our various duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Executive Officer cleared his throat and
proceeded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Baron von Hiemskirk keeps muttering over
and over in his delirium, &lsquo;<i>Er ist einer
Footballer</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;He
is a football player&mdash;.&rsquo; These
words may mean nothing; on the other hand,
they may be the means of identifying his assailants.
Until our beloved Captain regains his
reason, nothing can be done about it. Thank
you, gentlemen, for your interest and attention.
I bid you all goodmorning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meeting dispersed, the officers going
their several ways. Bill and Osceola, having
no duties to perform, strolled around the
promenade deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to be hoped that our beloved Captain
does not regain his reason until this ship has
been captured by the battleships on her trail,&rdquo;
muttered Osceola to Bill, mimicking the Executive
Officer&rsquo;s formal manner of address.</p>
<p>Bill nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;You said a
mouthful, boy. I&rsquo;m afraid you and I will be in
for it good and plenty if he wakes up beforehand.
That bunch we just left are a dumb
crew. But there are no flies on the skipper. He
had our histories down pat from the newspapers
when we met him on the <i>Merrymaid</i>. He&rsquo;s
sure to know you play on Carlisle and that I&rsquo;m
on the Navy eleven. What with our previous
record, so to speak, in the way of cleaning up
dirty messes, that guy won&rsquo;t miss any bets.
We&rsquo;ll be judged on suspicion if nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why Charlie didn&rsquo;t warn us that
the Baron was making for the wireless house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably didn&rsquo;t get a chance. If the kid
had been caught, we&rsquo;d have heard of it before
this. Schneider told me that all passengers are
being confined to their cabins, so we won&rsquo;t see
him today. Charlie and his doings don&rsquo;t worry
me just now&mdash;but the weather does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the weather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that haze over there to the northward?
We&rsquo;re steaming into fog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that even if the <i>Stamford</i> catches
up to within firing distance we might be able
to elude her after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the big idea. In about half an hour
we won&rsquo;t be able to see ten feet over the side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe we&rsquo;ll run through it by this
afternoon. The <i>Stamford</i> won&rsquo;t catch up to
us for some hours yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; replied Bill. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done all
we could, anyway. From now on, the job&rsquo;s up
to the Navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried Osceola, as they swung
round the end of the superstructure and into
the long stretch of deck on the port side. &ldquo;Look
off yonder! What do you make that out to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill shaded his eyes. The glare of the
smooth ocean was dazzling in the sun. Away
to the northeast a ship was nosing out of fog
banks that lined the northern horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks to me mighty like a warship!&rdquo;
said the chief excitedly. &ldquo;She certainly is
humping it, brother. But I thought the <i>Stamford</i>
was to the south of us&mdash;and when she
came, she&rsquo;d come from behind!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve certainly got a pair of eyes&mdash;and
she certainly <i>is</i> a warship. I can&rsquo;t make her
out very well at that distance, but she looks to
me like a first class cruiser of the Plymouth
type. Dollars to ditchwater the <i>Stamford</i> wirelessed
her! She&rsquo;s heading for us all right, all
right. Oh, boy&mdash;there&rsquo;s going to be something
doing aboard this packet in two shakes of a
lamb&rsquo;s tail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar she blows!&rdquo; sang out the chief, as the
gong and bugle sounded for action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s quite time you and I beat it for our
battle stations. Everything is being made ready
for attack. If we&rsquo;re late, it won&rsquo;t look so good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola stopped and stared at Bill. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
tell me that you, a midshipman of the United
States Navy, are going to help these bum pirates
fight one of your own battleships!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>Bill looked at him and laughed. &ldquo;Some
patriotic little flagwaver, aren&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; he jeered.
&ldquo;No, Herr Junior Lieutenant, I do not intend
to shoot at the <i>Plymouth</i> or the <i>Reading</i>, or
whatever&rsquo;s the name of that cruiser. Have you
never played hare and hounds, Big Chief?
Well, this time, you and I and everybody on
board are hares. Those two 117-mm. guns
forward, and the two on the poop are all right
for scaring passenger liners and bringing unarmed
merchant-men to haul down their colors.
But they haven&rsquo;t the caliber or the range of
three-quarters of the guns aboard that cruiser.
This is going to be a race&mdash;not a battle! Beat
it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XV</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CHASE</span></h2>
<p>By the time Bill reached his station on the
poop, the quiet routine aboard the liner had
given way to activity. The <i>Amtonia</i> was awake
to the heat and fever of desperate life.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Schneider, who was in command
of the gun, seized Bill&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Bolton!&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;look there&mdash;she&rsquo;s changed her course!
She&rsquo;s going to head us off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shading his eyes with his hand, Bill strained
them toward the northern horizon. The great
molten surface of the sun was already half
obliterated by the spreading bank of fog that
turned the sea to dull amethyst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If that fog
keeps increasing, the visibility will soon be too
poor for the cruiser to get our range.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is Commander Geibel on the bridge.
The ship is in good hands&mdash;that is a blessing!&rdquo;
Lieutenant Schneider&rsquo;s tone betrayed his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sheering off to starboard&mdash;&rdquo; said Bill.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good news. It&rsquo;s going to be a close
thing, just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schneider jumped on the rail and leaned outward
in order to get a better view of the forward
end of the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Exec. has left the bridge!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down! He&rsquo;s probably run down the
steps and crossed that gangway to the foremast.
Yes, there he is! See him? He&rsquo;s climbed up
to the lookout. Gosh, that lad&rsquo;s got a voice.
You can hear him bellowing orders all over the
ship, I&rsquo;ll bet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good officer,&rdquo; admitted the Lieutenant,
getting off the rail. &ldquo;Too bad the Herr
Baron is not able to take command. He would
use the <i>Flying Fish</i> to get us out of this mess.&rdquo;
He pointed to the submarine racing along off
their starboard quarter. &ldquo;<i>Donner und Blitzen!</i>
I believe she is going to submerge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very best thing she could do, under the
circumstances,&rdquo; Bill asserted. &ldquo;What would
you have her do&mdash;head over yonder and let go
a torpedo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t she built for that kind of thing?&rdquo;
Lieutenant Schneider&rsquo;s tone was still nettled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she was, but not in a position of this
kind. That cruiser would blow her out of the
water before she got near enough to make a
torpedo effective!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, why don&rsquo;t you go aboard
her and get busy with her in the air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And stop both the <i>Flying Fish</i> and ourselves
while a boat is being lowered and I am ferried
over to her? Even if the <i>Amtonia</i> was able to
get away, the <i>Flying Fish</i> would be blown to
pieces long before she was ready to take off.
Weren&rsquo;t you in the merchant service before you
shipped aboard this raider?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was&mdash;but why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commander Geibel was an officer in the
Imperial German Navy. He fought through
the war. I&rsquo;ve never been in action before, but
I&rsquo;ve had a couple of years at the U. S. Naval
Academy and I know that our Commander is
doing the one thing possible to save his ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose you think it a waste of time
and effort for us to be manning the guns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill laughed good-naturedly and clapped the
incensed lieutenant on the shoulder. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not
fight about it. Clearing for action and manning
the guns is okay. It&rsquo;s splendid discipline
and helps the morale of the crew. But you
know just as well as I do, Schneider, that if we
win out, coal will do it, not gunpowder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; apologized the German, and
offered his hand.</p>
<p>Bill took it, feeling rather silly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it comes!&rdquo; he cried a moment later,
as a white cloud of smoke enveloped the
cruiser&rsquo;s forward turret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Missed!&rdquo; exclaimed the lieutenant. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t hand your compatriots much on their
shooting, Bolton. That shot didn&rsquo;t come within
a thousand meters of the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just meant as a warning,&rdquo; explained
Bill. &ldquo;Those gunners know they aren&rsquo;t
yet within range of this ship. It&rsquo;s the next five
minutes that&rsquo;s going to tell the tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Schneider studied the battleship
through his sea glasses. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s steaming more
to the eastward,&rdquo; he remarked sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve sheered off a point or two. The
fog&rsquo;s coming our way&mdash;and coming fast. It&rsquo;s
getting darker by the minute. The sun&rsquo;s almost
washed out. Gosh, this is better than a horse
race. Doesn&rsquo;t it give you a thrill, Schneider?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young officer grimaced. &ldquo;Not the kind
of thrill I enjoy, thank you. If that cruiser
suddenly blew up, I shouldn&rsquo;t weep. There&mdash;she&rsquo;s
firing again. Oh, if our guns could only
carry over to her!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>This time the projectile struck the water a
bare twenty yards ahead of the speeding liner.
So close was it that those aboard the <i>Amtonia</i>
felt the spray from the geyser that shot skyward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re within their range, now, that&rsquo;s a
cinch!&rdquo; Bill said calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll hull us, knowing that
there are passengers aboard, Bolton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re sure to, unless Commander Geibel
puts on the brakes. It&rsquo;s his responsibility, not
theirs. That last shot was an order to stop.
The Commander is paying no attention to it.
He&rsquo;s evidently decided to take the risk. You
can&rsquo;t blame him. Give us another minute and
we&rsquo;ll be in the fog. Those prisoners below-decks,
or passengers, as you call them, will have
to take their chance with the rest of us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>There came a terrific crash which jarred the
ship from end to end. Every man of the gun
crew was thrown to the deck. For several
seconds the <i>Amtonia</i> trembled like a live thing
in agony. Her speed slackened materially.
But before the dazed men could scramble to
their feet, she was blanketed in a protecting
cloak of fog. Bells rang, men shouted orders,
and the wounded ship swung round to the
northwest with a suddenness that sent her over
at a sharp angle while the crew went rolling
into the starboard scuppers.</p>
<p>There was no more firing from the cruiser.
The race, for the time being, was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Bill, as he picked himself up,
&ldquo;is what I call a direct hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know it!&rdquo; stormed Schneider. &ldquo;If
my knee isn&rsquo;t fractured it&rsquo;s no fault of this
deck!&rdquo; He limped over to the rail and leaned
against it. &ldquo;Thanks be to Neptune for this
fog&mdash;that&rsquo;s a blessing, if nothing else is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; chaffed Bill. &ldquo;When the
skipper wakes up he&rsquo;ll pin an iron cross on you.
First casualty, you know. Wounded in the line
of duty and all that&mdash;which reminds me,&rdquo; he
went on more seriously, &ldquo;that there are likely
to be other casualties aboard. That shot struck
somewhere aft, if I know anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Schneider. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
remain with the gun crew until we&rsquo;re released
from this duty. Suppose you go forward. See
the Commander, if you can. If he&rsquo;s not on the
bridge, speak to whoever is in charge, and find
out what the damage is. The ship is no more
than limping along now. I&rsquo;m sure there is
serious trouble somewhere. Tell the Commander
I&rsquo;m standing by with these men and if
extra help is needed, they can get busy at once.
There&rsquo;s nothing to do here. Oh, I forgot to
say&mdash;give him my compliments. My knee is
paining me so, I can hardly think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; chuckled Bill. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
disgrace you. Bye-bye. I&rsquo;ll fetch some liniment
from the dispensary on my way back, if
I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He touched his cap and ran forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>En route he met several parties of men hurrying
toward companionways, but without stopping
to question them, he made his way with all
possible speed to the steps which led to the
bridge and raced up. There he encountered
Lieutenant Commander Hoffman, the navigation
officer. He came to attention three paces
in front of the frowning officer and saluted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Schneider&rsquo;s compliments, sir,&rdquo;
he said crisply. &ldquo;The lieutenant wishes to
know if his gun crew can be of service to you.
He knows, of course, that the ship was hit, but
so far has received no further information or
orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Lieutenant Schneider for me,&rdquo; the
officer replied with all the ramrod formality of
the Imperial German Navy. &ldquo;Say to him that
the schwein-dog cruiser shot off one of our propellers.
What other damage has been done, I
have not as yet ascertained, but I believe it to
be of a minor character. Commander Geibel has
gone below to investigate. Until he returns, it
will be well for the Lieutenant to stand by with
his gun crew and await orders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir.&rdquo; Bill had been standing
rigidly at attention while Herr Hoffman discoursed.
His first salute had been of the type
that any Navy Man would term &ldquo;seagoing,&rdquo; but
into his parting gesture, he put all the snap
that only an Annapolis Midshipman is capable
of. Turning smartly on his heel, he ran lightly
down the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that will hold him for a while,&rdquo; he
muttered, making for a companionway. &ldquo;Discipline
is discipline, but that guy talks as if you
were bilge under his feet, the pompous, hard-boiled
egg! Dollars to ditchwater that pirate
was either a C.P.O. or a Warrant when the
Dutchmen had a Navy. That kind are always
the snootiest when they&rsquo;re sprouting gold
stripes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was gross libel, as it happened, but it
soothed Bill&rsquo;s feelings, and he found himself
whistling Yankee Doodle as he ran down to the
ship&rsquo;s dispensary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Schneider got a crack on the
knee,&rdquo; he told the mate in charge. &ldquo;Got a
bottle of liniment handy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough stuff here to stock a hospital,
sir. If the Lieutenant is willing, I&rsquo;ll go
with him. All I&rsquo;ve done on this voyage is to
hand out medicine and hold basins for seasick
women. It will be a real pleasure, if my officer
permits. Herman can look after the shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your officer permits, all right,&rdquo; laughed
Bill. &ldquo;Grab your bottle, Jack, and come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; beamed the man. He
picked up a large black bag and heaving it to
his shoulder, strode down the passage after Bill.</p>
<p>Back on the poop, Bill found Osceola talking
to Lieutenant Schneider, who seemed in considerable
pain. While the dispensary&rsquo;s man
brought out liniment and gauze and began to
ease the young German&rsquo;s suffering, Bill delivered
Lieutenant Commander Hoffman&rsquo;s
message. Then the two friends moved over
to the rail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just come up from the engine room,&rdquo;
said the Seminole. &ldquo;There was a good deal of
confusion below when the propeller was shot
off, and the engines were racing and all. Things
have quieted down a bit now. The chief told
Geibel that the propeller was taken off clean as
a whistle. He went down the shaft-tunnel and
found she was leaking a little through the
stuffing-box, but nothing to write home about.
His men are attending to that and we&rsquo;re running
on the other propeller now. Nobody hurt,
I&rsquo;m glad to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the Commander will try to
have another fitted onto the shaft while we&rsquo;re
at sea,&rdquo; remarked Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s why I looked you up as soon
as I could. I heard him tell the chief engineer
that it was his intention to make at once for
their base. They didn&rsquo;t go into detail, but from
what they said I guess it&rsquo;s an almost landlocked
harbor on the Maine coast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s news,&rdquo; declared Bill. &ldquo;Good news!
Once we&rsquo;re in touch with land our chances of
escape will be a thousand percent better.
Hello&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off, &ldquo;what are these chaps
up to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six seamen, armed with rifles, a Chief Petty
Officer and Lieutenant Brinkerhoff, whom they
both knew slightly, were advancing along the
deck toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenants Bolton and Osceola,&rdquo; said the
officer stiffly, &ldquo;you are hereby placed under
arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up. &ldquo;And by whose
orders&mdash;may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By order of the Herr Baron von Hiemskirk,&rdquo;
thundered the officer. &ldquo;You gentlemen
will come with me at once, if you please!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XVI</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">PRISONERS</span></h2>
<p>The seamen closed in about Bill and Osceola
and they were marched off, walking side by
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our noble Captain has evidently waked up,&rdquo;
said Bill in an undertone to his friend. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
where we catch it, good and plenty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think then that he did recognize us
last night?&rdquo; Osceola&rsquo;s voice was lowered to a
whisper.</p>
<p>Bill nodded. &ldquo;One or both of us. We can&rsquo;t
deny it, you know. He&rsquo;d only make it the worse
for those innocent suspects Geibel was talking
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose he&rsquo;ll do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot us&mdash;very likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Bill&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Lieutenant Brinkerhoff&rsquo;s acid voice cut him
short. &ldquo;My orders are that you gentlemen will
refrain from all conversation. You will be
good enough to obey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill shrugged and Osceola nodded his acceptance
of this dictum. They moved forward
in silence.</p>
<p>With the ramrod form of Brinkerhoff leading
the way, the little procession filed along the
decks until they reached the captain&rsquo;s cabin.
Here the lieutenant knocked, then entered, closing
the door.</p>
<p>Presently he reappeared and beckoned them
inside. Bill noted that two of the armed seamen
followed them over the threshold. Apparently
the wounded captain was taking no chances of
further assault.</p>
<p>They found Baron von Hiemskirk propped
up in bed with a pile of pillows at his back.
Around his head was a linen bandage. He
looked pale and ill and seemed to be in some
pain. Seated beside the bed Commander Geibel
watched him devotedly, and at the foot stood
the ship&rsquo;s doctor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>At a sign from Brinkerhoff, the lads approached
the sick man. He opened his eyes and
looked at them with a keen, appraising glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&mdash;my young friends,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;You
couldn&rsquo;t leave well enough alone, but must try
to interfere with the excellent routine of my
ship, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you captured us last Monday,&rdquo; said
Bill, &ldquo;and we had our chat aboard the <i>Merrymaid</i>,
I warned you that we would do our best
to make things hot for you and your crew if
you insisted upon our working for you. I believe
you understood my warning. At that time
you said that your system was perfect. And
that we were at liberty to do what we could to
disrupt it so long as we attended to the duties
given us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! So you do not deny wrecking the
ship&rsquo;s wireless last night, and sending messages
to enemy warships? Not to mention your
attack upon my person&mdash;and the vast amount of
trouble your disgraceful conduct has caused my
officers and crew today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we do not deny it,&rdquo; Bill asserted
steadily. &ldquo;Chief Osceola and I did exactly what
you describe. But believe me when I say that
it was no part of our plan that you should be
injured. You have been courteous to us on board
here. We both regret your&mdash;accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. But that does not alter the rest
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. My duty as an officer of the United
States Navy is to break up your pirate organization
by any means in my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my duty, as Captain of this ship, is to
have you both executed for mutiny. You are
aware of that, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you, Baron,&rdquo; Bill continued
earnestly. &ldquo;That I alone am to blame. It was
my plan and only mine. Chief Osceola worked
under my orders throughout.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>Osceola took a step forward. &ldquo;Oh, cut out
all this formality!&rdquo; His dark eyes flashed, first
on the Baron and then on Bill. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t
you try taking all the blame yourself. I&rsquo;m just
as guilty as you are. What&rsquo;s more, you know
right well that if I&rsquo;d had my way I&rsquo;d have
thrown that Hun welcher over the rail instead
of bothering to tie him up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Osceola,&rdquo; warned his friend.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m running our end of this show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now, you&rsquo;re not&mdash;by a darn sight, Bill!
I&rsquo;ve got a few words to say to the captain myself.
Baron von Hiemskirk,&rdquo; he turned to the
big man on the bed, &ldquo;do you realize that if you
have us murdered, you put a rope around your
own neck and the necks of every one of your
officers and crew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One has to catch his fish before eating it,&rdquo;
said von Hiemskirk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;True. And every warship on the Atlantic
has a description of this particular fish by now.
Are you egotist enough to believe that you can
buck the Naval forces of the world and get
away with it? Don&rsquo;t tell me that you, who have
made an enemy of all society by your racketeering
and piracy, spare crews and passengers of
captured ships through any motive of kindness!
You are afraid to send them to the bottom.
Why? Because, Herr Baron von Bluff, you
are afraid to kill them! You know the penalty
for murder&mdash;you have funked it every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! But not this time, young man.
Secrets have a way of leaking out aboard ship,
I admit. But in your case we shall take no
chances whatever. In a day or two, you will
be removed from the <i>Amtonia</i> and disappear
completely and effectually, far from the haunts
of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;you think you will be any
safer in the state of Maine than you are on the
high seas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron started up in bed. &ldquo;And what do
you know about the state of Maine?&rdquo; he
thundered, visibly perturbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only what I broadcasted last night,&rdquo;
grinned Bill. &ldquo;As you remarked just now,
&lsquo;secrets have a way of leaking out on shipboard.&rsquo;
You have implicit confidence in your officers
and crew of course. Did it never occur to you
that there might be a traitor amongst your devoted
band?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away with them!&rdquo; shouted the Baron, now
thoroughly angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one moment&mdash;may I say a few words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron was the type of bully who loves
to see a victim cringe. From the young Seminole&rsquo;s
tone, he was sure the lad was frightened,
and that he would beg for his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it short. What is it you want to
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this, sir. With such a captain, the
Jolly Roger is no longer a fitting ensign for this
ship. May I, in all humility, suggest that instead
of a white skull and crossed bones on a
black field, you substitute a lollipop? A green
one would be appropriate&mdash;and floating on a
broad field of bright yellow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;T-take them away!&rdquo; stuttered the Baron,
purple with rage.</p>
<p>As they were hustled along the passageway,
they could hear him hoarsely shouting invective
after them. But as his further rantings were in
German, Osceola understood not a word of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; murmured Bill. &ldquo;It would make
me blush to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the brawny seaman who had Osceola by
the arm, reminded him of the order for silence,
Osceola merely chuckled. But he continued to
do so until they were far below the waterline in
the very bowels of the ship.</p>
<p>Eventually they came to a long passage running
fore and aft. Electric bulbs in the ceiling
brightly lighted the corridor on either side of
which doors opened into tiny cabins, evidently
the quarters for stewards and the ship&rsquo;s petty
officers. Half way down a steel-barred gate
blocked this passageway from floor to ceiling.
Before it lounged an armed sentry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>The man straightened to attention as the
party approached. Brinkerhoff presented
a paper which he read carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; he pocketed the order and
saluted. &ldquo;All cells are full, sir, except the first
on the right. Better stick them in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unlocked the gate while the Lieutenant
pushed Bill and Osceola into an empty cell.
Without a word the officer slammed shut the
door. The gate clanged and they were left
together in their prison.</p>
<p>The cell boasted no illumination of its own.
What light and ventilation there was came
through the door, which, like the gate in the
passage, was constructed of crossed bars of steel.
It was no more than a cubby-hole. There were
two narrow bunks, one above the other on one
side; across from these, a washbowl and toilet.
There was no other furniture. Both the cell
and the corridor were terribly hot and stuffy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this isn&rsquo;t so bad, I&rsquo;ve had worse
quarters,&rdquo; Bill remarked philosophically.
&ldquo;When the Baron took over this ship and needed
a special brig for his prisoners, he slapped that
gate into the passageway and put others in
place of the doors to these cabins. The sidewalls
are of wood. If we had some tools, it
wouldn&rsquo;t be such a job to get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! but we haven&rsquo;t any! And <i>if</i> we
had, and could cut our way through into the
next cabin, outside the gate, where would we
go from there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were speaking in whispers, for the
sentry outside the gate was only a yard or so
from their door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve been in worse fixes. This will
take some thinking out,&rdquo; answered Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse fixes?&rdquo; Osceola&rsquo;s shoulders moved
impatiently. &ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo; He sat down on
the edge of a bunk. &ldquo;Just because these bozos
have been more or less polite, don&rsquo;t get the idea
they aren&rsquo;t dangerous customers. That Baron
means to put our lights out. You got him
worried when you sprung that Maine story on
him, and I purposely got him just as angry as
I could.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was your big idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I figured that when he thought it
over later, it would lead him to believe we really
did have something up our sleeves&mdash;some
certain means of rescue or escape. A big bully
like he is would reason that we&rsquo;d never have the
nerve to bait him otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it may help to postpone the&mdash;er&mdash;evil
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am hoping so. If I size that guy up right,
he&rsquo;ll make watchful waiting his cue for a few
days anyway. He&rsquo;ll want to see if anything
really happens before he puts his own head into
a noose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>when</i> nothing happens, we&rsquo;ll be put on
the spot for that same reason!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s always another day, Bill. Say,
you&rsquo;re not up to your usual form this morning.
I&rsquo;ll bet you got no sleep last night. You&rsquo;d
better turn in now and take a siesta.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that soon, Osceola. But I&rsquo;m interested
in our fellow prisoners. You know, we&rsquo;re
lucky&mdash;our one consolation is that there wasn&rsquo;t
room in this dump to separate us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet.&rdquo; Osceola yawned and standing
up, stripped down to a pair of shorts. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
the dope on those lads,&rdquo; he said, as he climbed
into the upper berth. &ldquo;I heard Geibel telling
the Chief Engineer that he&rsquo;d jailed all the
suspects on the wireless business. We&rsquo;re down
here with a bunch of multi-millionaires. Does
that make you feel any better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come?&rdquo; whispered the chief from his
bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see? With all the gaff we
gave the Baron, he&rsquo;ll suspect we&rsquo;re in cahoots
with one or more of them&mdash;and keep them
down here, where they can&rsquo;t help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola grunted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sure got it in for
the poor money kings&mdash;what have you got
against &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, you&rsquo;re thick!&rdquo; snorted his friend.
&ldquo;So long as they fill the cells we&rsquo;ll be together.
It&rsquo;s a heap easier for us to get out of <i>one</i> cell,
together, than it would be to get out of two,
separately!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, you&rsquo;re talking in circles. We now
arrive at the fact, once more, that we have no
tools with which to get out! Take my advice
and snatch a nap. You need it worse than I
do, and this little Indian is going shut-eye right
now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XVII</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">CHARLIE&rsquo;S NOTE</span></h2>
<p>For the next couple of days, Bill and Osceola
sweated in their hot-box of a cell. What with
the heat, the lack of proper ventilation, and the
uncertainty of their fate, both lads sank into a
state of mind that bordered on despondency.</p>
<p>The monotony of their existence was broken
but three times a day, when meals were brought
to the prisoners&rsquo; cells by a steward. The man
was invariably accompanied by the armed
sentry, who acted as turnkey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>There appeared to be no possible means of
escape. Day and night the electric lights in
the passage beyond the steel bars burned
brightly. The sentry outside the gate was relieved
by another seaman every four hours, with
the change of watch. With nothing to read,
nothing to do, the lads spent most of their time
lying in the bunks or taking turns pacing the
narrow confines of their cell.</p>
<p>Sunday night, shortly after ten o&rsquo;clock the
tremble of the ship&rsquo;s engines stopped. The lads
guessed that the <i>Amtonia</i> had reached her destination
at last. Half an hour later they heard
the sentry speaking to someone in the passage
just beyond the gate. Although the conversation
was carried on in German, Bill was able to
get the gist of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Hans?&rdquo; inquired the
sentry. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going ashore with the rest
of the boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; replied Hans. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to start
swabbing out bathrooms at four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; the sentry declared,
&ldquo;just as soon as Otto relieves me at midnight.
It isn&rsquo;t often we have the chance to stretch our
legs ashore and have a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;If your idea of a good time is to swill
American homebrew in a speakeasy, it&rsquo;s not
mine,&rdquo; the other retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Munich,
I am. Good brown Lionsbrew for me. I
can&rsquo;t stomach the stuff they sell you on this
side. Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been on my feet all day
long. My legs get all the stretching they want
aboard this ship. I&rsquo;m tired&mdash;good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lads heard the door of the cabin next to
them slam shut as Hans went to his well-earned
rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; laughed Bill, &ldquo;is the first bit of
comedy I&rsquo;ve heard since we landed aboard this
blooming pirate. That Heinie&rsquo;s a sensible man.
We might as well turn in, too. Tomorrow, I
suppose, they&rsquo;ll take us ashore and stand us up
against a stone fence. I for one don&rsquo;t want to
think any more about it than I have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on talking&mdash;don&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; said Osceola
in a low voice. &ldquo;Either Hans or someone else
next door is scraping on his side of the wall.
I&rsquo;ll try to find out what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>Bill nodded and immediately launched into a
long account of the Army and Navy football
game in which he had played the previous fall.
Meanwhile Osceola climbed into the lower
bunk, and lying flat, pressed his ear against the
wooden partition which separated their cell
from the bath-steward&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>The slight scraping continued and presently
the sharp-eyed Seminole saw the point of a knife
appear through a board. The slit slowly widened,
and a folded piece of paper was pushed
halfway through. Osceola grabbed it and
scanned the writing that covered both sides. He
passed it to Bill, who accomplished the difficult
feat of reading it while continuing his story of
the football game. The handwriting, though
tiny, was unformed and he guessed at once that
the message was from Charlie. It ran:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Bill&mdash;Hans is my bath stewward. He
is O.K. Have promissed Dad will make him
rich for life if he helps you and the cheif. He
will cut through the boards to your cell. Hang
your blankits down over the edge of your upper
bearth so as to deden sound. He will push
through another knife so you can do some cuting.
I think the other one better talk or sing or something
so the centry can&rsquo;t here you cuting. If
you get away take Hans to. His name will be
mud after this on board the <i>Amtonia</i>.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;Yours truley,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;Charles Evans.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bill smiled broadly as he pocketed the boyish,
misspelled note. Then, still keeping up his
endless monologue anent football, he hung the
blankets, forming a curtain which completely
shut in the lower bunk. Osceola was already
at work with a knife that Hans had passed
through the opening.</p>
<p>Bill continued to talk for the next twenty
minutes, but then he pulled aside one corner of
the blanket. The bunk was like a bake oven.
Osceola was sweating from every pore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My turn now. Come out, and don&rsquo;t forget
to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Osceola handed the knife to Bill, grabbed his
clothes and slipped out of the bunk.</p>
<p>Immediately Bill climbed in and divested
himself of the underclothes he wore. Because
of the heat, neither of the lads had been clothed
in more than their undershirts and shorts since
their incarceration. As the blanket dropped
back into place, he heard Osceola begin a recital
of some hunting trip he had taken down in the
Florida everglades. He was surprised to find
how the double blankets deadened the sound of
his friend&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>It was pitch dark in the bunk. He was just
beginning to wonder exactly where he should
get to work when a light appeared through two
parallel slits in the wall-boards. These, he saw,
were about three feet long and perhaps a foot
and a half apart. From the cabin beyond the
voice of Hans came in a sibilant whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;If the Herr Lieutenant will be good enough
to start cutting across the boards from the bottom
of one slit to the bottom of the other? I
shall work on the top end. It is not necessary to
tell the Lieutenant not to press too hard with his
knife. The sound of splintering wood can
be heard in the passage. There is no need to
disturb the sentry&mdash;just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill heard the steward chuckle. Then,
except for the very slight sound of the knives
as they cut across the grain of the wood, no other
came to his ears save the low mumble of Osceola&rsquo;s
voice beyond the blankets.</p>
<p>It was hard work and tedious, slicing across
the grain of the boards. The heat made Bill
dizzy, and he stopped frequently to wipe away
the sweat that streamed down into his eyes.
After what seemed an endless age, Hans spoke
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have cut through to the farther slit, sir.
Will the Herr Lieutenant be good enough now
to place the palm of his hand against the piece
that is to come out? There must be no cracking
of the wood when we remove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; whispered Bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Less than five minutes later, he completed
his job. Hans took the panel they had cut from
the wall and switched off the light in his cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand by,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be with you
just as soon as I can get a drink and put on my
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; returned the man, and Bill
climbed out of the bunk.</p>
<p>He went at once to the washbasin where he
rinsed out his mouth and drank a few swallows
of the tepid water. A quick sluice and a rubdown
followed. Then he got quickly into his
white linen uniform. Osceola, who was already
dressed, spent the time in taking down the
blankets, folding them and tossing them onto
the upper berth. Far down the passageway they
heard a bell tinkle eight times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midnight,&rdquo; said Bill, in a low tone. &ldquo;Yes,
there&rsquo;s Otto, relieving our weary sentry at last.
We&rsquo;ll give him five minutes to vamoose, then
we&rsquo;ll get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>That seemed the longest five minutes of
their lives. They kept their eyes glued on the
luminous dials of their wrist-watches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up!&rdquo; said Bill at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the second,&rdquo; was the Seminole&rsquo;s sole
comment. One after the other they got into
the lower berth and squeezed through the opening
in the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan now, Hans?&rdquo; Bill whispered
in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With permission, sir, I will go into the
passage and talk to Otto, who is on watch now.
I will leave the cabin door ajar, sir, and as soon
as his back is turned, it will be well if the
gentlemen come out and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scrag him,&rdquo; Bill supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, sir. Here are four pieces of rope
and a gag. That ought to be enough to keep
Otto quiet. Will the gentlemen please take me
with them,&rdquo; he asked somewhat diffidently,
&ldquo;when they leave the ship?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;You bet we will!&rdquo; said Osceola. &ldquo;Only
don&rsquo;t be so darned polite. You make me nervous.
Cut along now, we&rsquo;ll attend to Otto just as
soon as you get him facing the right way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hans opened the door and went out, leaving
it slightly ajar. From the shadows beside it,
the lads saw him approach the sentry, who
lounged on a stool by the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too hot in there to sleep,&rdquo; remarked Hans.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going above to catch a breath of air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I could!&rdquo; The sentry placed his rifle
against the wall. &ldquo;This ship is an oven below-decks.
Practically the whole port watch has
gone ashore. Just my bad luck to be stuck down
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the size of that rat!&rdquo; exclaimed the
steward, pointing down the prison corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Otto swung round toward the
barred gate.</p>
<p>Hans immediately caught up the rifle and
pressed the muzzle against the man&rsquo;s side.
&ldquo;One peep out of you,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
give you a bellyful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>Otto stared at him dazedly. Before he could
decide whether or not to make a move, Bill
thrust the gag in his mouth, while Osceola
caught his wrists and lashed them fast behind
his back.</p>
<p>It took only a moment longer to tie up his
ankles. Otto was laid on the floor, and with
Hans in the lead and carrying the rifle, the three
hurried down the passage away from the gate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1"><span class="sc">Chapter XVIII</span></span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE FLYING FISH PLAYS ITS PART</span></h2>
<p>Hans led them up through the galleys and
pantries into the First Class Dining Saloon without
encountering a single soul. They went
boldly up the main staircase to the promenade
deck, which seemed deserted. A small figure
hiding in the shadows ran up to them, and
Charlie gripped his friends&rsquo; hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the thanks,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to work fast. There&rsquo;s an armed
seaman at the gangway head. We must quiet
him first. Then we&rsquo;ll take the ship&rsquo;s boat that&rsquo;s
moored below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word, Bill walked up to the
gangway sentry, who immediately brought his
rifle to the present.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s rust on that barrel,&rdquo; growled Bill
and held out his hand. &ldquo;I can see it even in
this light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but I think,&rdquo; stammered the sentry,
&ldquo;that my officer is mistaken!&rdquo; He passed over
the gun without suspicion.</p>
<p>Immediately afterward, he found himself in
the same dilemma Otto had encountered ten
minutes earlier. Tied up and gagged with a
handkerchief, he was deposited behind a pile
of deck chairs.</p>
<p>His captors wasted no further time. They
ran down the gangway and piled aboard the
skiff moored to the grating. Hans got out the
single pair of oars, Osceola unloosed the painter,
and Bill, who seated himself beside Charlie in
the stern, steered their small craft away from
the ship. There were men on the <i>Amtonia&rsquo;s</i>
bridge but they received no hail to return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>Bill looked about. Although there was no
moon, the brilliant starlight gave ample light
for him to size up his surroundings. He found
that they were floating in a large cove or harbor
almost landlocked. The body of water was
eggshaped; perhaps a mile long by half that
distance in width. The shores were rocky, with
black patches of sandy beach. Beyond grew a
dense forest, except at one end of the bay, where
twinkling lights marked a small settlement.
The outlet to the ocean was narrow, and
guarded by high cliffs. It was a perfect retreat
for the Baron and his pirates.</p>
<p>Charlie piped up in his boyish treble. &ldquo;The
<i>Amtonia&rsquo;s</i> absolutely hidden by those heads
from any ship passing up or down the coast.
The harbor entrance makes a right-angled turn
half way to the sea. I heard Lieutenant Brinkerhoff
say that a warship passed the mouth, going
west, about eleven-thirty. The lookout on
the head signalled in. Brinkerhoff was laughing
about it, I guess it made him feel good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, his break is ours now,&rdquo; declared Bill.
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another one for us!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>He pointed to where the <i>Flying Fish</i> lay
moored, with her wings spread, a few hundred
yards away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be hot as Tophet in her hull tonight!
Row on, Hans. We&rsquo;re going over there to pay
a visit. By the way, does anyone know exactly
where we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;this harbor is on
the coast of Maine. Washington County, I
think, sir&mdash;not very far from Englishman&rsquo;s
Bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough! What are those lights yonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might call that our private Navy Yard,
sir. It&rsquo;s the Baron&rsquo;s shore base. He keeps a
crew on duty there, while the ships are at sea.
There are storehouses, a machine shop, the men&rsquo;s
quarters and a store. It&rsquo;s ten miles back to the
railroad. He owns all the shore acreage hereabouts.
A high wire fence shuts in the property
from all outsiders. There are one or two big
estates up and down the coast, but the nearest
house is a good three miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;How are the roads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no road along the coast, sir. The
one from the base runs back to the little town
on the railroad. It&rsquo;s in very bad condition, sir.
There is no other way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Hans. You&rsquo;re a treasure-house
of local knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank <i>you</i>, sir. May I make a suggestion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother, August, is deck watch aboard
the <i>Flying Fish</i>, sir. Usually, in port, only one
man is kept aboard her. August does not like
this life. Like me, he was shanghaied into it.
Once with this outfit, there is no getting away,
unless by a miracle, like tonight, sir. August
speaks no English. May I ask him to join us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means, Hans. It will save a lot of
trouble. Offer him what Mrs. Evans said she
would give you. I will see that it is paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>They were close to the converted submarine
now. On the narrow deck, abaft the motors
a man was seated on a camp chair, smoking.
He stood up as the boat approached.</p>
<p>Hans hailed him and for several minutes the
two brothers hurled harsh gutturals at each
other. Bill guessed them to be speaking a low
Bavarian dialect of German. He failed to understand
a single word of what they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants me to thank you&mdash;he will come,&rdquo;
Hans asserted presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a polite family you are&mdash;&rdquo; chuckled
Bill. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later those officers and men
who had remained on deck aboard the anchored
pirate ship were astonished to see the <i>Flying
Fish</i> taxi down the harbor and take the air. A
few seconds later her tail lights disappeared
into the dark beyond the headlands. Aboard
the <i>Amtonia</i> orders were shouted, bells clanged,
and presently the whining howl of her siren
awoke the echoes of the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>Half an hour passed. Bill, at the wheel of
the <i>Flying Fish</i>, leaned forward, his eyes
focussed on a pinpoint of light far below and
about ten miles ahead of the speeding airplane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is on a bet,&rdquo; he said to Osceola,
who was in the other pilot&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the warship Charlie told us
about? What makes you so sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a hunch, that&rsquo;s all. Anyway, nothing
but a fishing boat or one of the little steamers
that put in at the small seaports along this part
of the coast would be so close to shore. That&rsquo;s
a big ship out there. I think I&rsquo;m right about
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s hunch was correct, as the two in the
cockpit presently saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the <i>Stamford</i>, or her twin!&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;Uncle Sam sure is on the job!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catching up with the cruiser, he circled her
three times. Then the <i>Flying Fish</i> darted
ahead, landed and came to rest half a mile beyond.
By the time the warship hove to beside
them, Bill had a sea anchor out and was waiting
on the heaving deck. He held a megaphone in
his hand. Beside him, staring at the big cruiser,
stood Osceola, Charlie, Hans and August.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;What craft is that?&rdquo; came a hail from the
warship&rsquo;s bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The convertible submarine-seaplane, <i>Flying
Fish</i>, Midshipman William Bolton in command,&rdquo;
Bill yelled back. &ldquo;She was part of von
Hiemskirk&rsquo;s pirate outfit. She belongs to Uncle
Sam now. We captured her less than an hour
ago. Are you the <i>Stamford</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve guessed it!&rdquo; spoke a jubilant voice.
&ldquo;Commander Brown speaking,&rdquo; it went on,
&ldquo;are you the chaps who sent out that wireless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, Mr. Bolton. Where is
the <i>Amtonia</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At anchor in a small harbor a few miles up
the coast, sir. One of her propellers was shot
off in the scrap the other day. She hasn&rsquo;t got
steam up, or didn&rsquo;t have, when we left&mdash;so I
guess she&rsquo;s still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Take off at once and lead us to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir. There&rsquo;s plenty of water but
the channel to the harbor is a narrow one between
twin heads. You&rsquo;ll have to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Bolton. Any other suggestions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Please wireless to the state constabulary
to guard the road from Twin Head Harbor
to Clayton. That&rsquo;s the only way von
Hiemskirk and his crew can escape by land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll attend to it at once,&rdquo; said the Commander.
&ldquo;Cut along now. We&rsquo;ll follow you,
so don&rsquo;t get too far ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, sir,&rdquo; said Bill, and sent Hans forward
to haul in the sea anchor.</p>
<p>The first pale rays of summer dawn were
brightening sea and land when the <i>Stamford</i>
navigated the entrance between Twin Heads and
pushed her wicked snout into the harbor. At
the same instant, Bill landed the <i>Flying Fish</i> on
the calm water.</p>
<p>Through the cockpit windows Bill saw that
the <i>Amtonia</i> was raising her anchors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;Von Hiemskirk was all set to run for it,&rdquo;
he said to the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he wasn&rsquo;t quite quick enough,&rdquo; grinned
Osceola. &ldquo;Next stop, Atlanta, for that bunch.
There&rsquo;s mighty little pirating to be done in a
federal prison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re hauling down the Jolly Roger!&rdquo;
cried Bill. &ldquo;Well, that cuts it. Somebody will
be sending a boat over here after awhile. Let&rsquo;s
see if we can rustle some chow in the meantime.
I&rsquo;m starved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat came alongside shortly after the five
aboard the <i>Flying Fish</i> had finished doing justice
to a very substantial breakfast. And all
five were on deck when the ensign in charge
came over the side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bolton?&rdquo; inquired the young officer, as
Bill stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Himself,&rdquo; smiled Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Pierce, of the <i>Stamford</i>.&rdquo; The two
shook hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;Commander Brown&rsquo;s compliments,&rdquo; he continued
after Bill had introduced the quartet,
&ldquo;he wishes you to come aboard the <i>Amtonia</i>.
We wirelessed the news, of course, and have
just received a message of thanks addressed to
you, signed by the President. You are to go
to Washington, just as soon as this business here
is cleaned up. In fact, the President wants to
meet the five of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet Bill will get the Congressional
Medal!&rdquo; shrilled Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised,&rdquo; smiled Pierce.
&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; he exploded, &ldquo;this is a big thing you
fellows have put over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Bill was the brains of it,&rdquo; said Osceola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without everybody&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;we
never should have pulled it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the argument,&rdquo; laughed Ensign Pierce.
&ldquo;The skipper is waiting, and so are several hundred
delighted passengers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; protested Bill, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather
be shot than face that mob!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Not me!</i>&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;Gee, it&rsquo;ll be
swell! Because I was the youngest on board,
everybody took pleasure in jumping on me.
Now I can tell them all where to shove off!
Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
